Using data from LinkedIn\u2019s Economic Graph, we analyzed the roles that companies are rapidly hiring for, the skills associated with them, and the roles that have emerged over the last five years.",

In fact, we started to see glimmers of this in last year\u2019s report, however both fields are starting to see more specialized roles emerge. It also may not shock you that Blockchain Developer is topping the list following this year\u2019s surge in interest around blockchain and cryptocurrency.",

A look at emerging skills on LinkedIn suggests that while the world of AI is still nascent, we are already seeing its impact on the labor market -- sometimes in unexpected places.",

        "Researchers predict that AI will have applications across nearly every industry sector -- from manufacturing to financial services and beyond. We looked across industries to figure out whether AI is still confined to the software industry, or if it has begun to spill over and impact other fields. The answer? Nearly every industry is starting to see an influx of AI-related skills.",
        "As AI skills become increasingly relevant, we were also interested in better understanding whether typically \u201chuman\u201d skills \u2013 e.g., those related to personal characteristics, interpersonal communication and cognitive skills \u2013 are on the rise as well. Our finding may not come as a surprise: at least for now, humanity isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
        "On average, more than one in four (26%) of all skills reported in 2017 by LinkedIn members based in the US can be classified as interpersonal or soft skills. Soft skills like project management and leadership are also among the fastest-growing \u201cunique\u201d skills. Consider positions like \u201cSystem Engineer\u201d -- in 2015, soft and interpersonal skills made up less than 1% of the skills required to succeed on the job. Now, they make up 8%. There is no doubt that AI skills are on the rise, but some typically human skills that today cannot be replicated by machines have been growing almost as fast and are here to stay.",

        "It\u2019s important for your CV to do justice to your skills and experience. I\u2019m not going to go into the minute details here but the main tip is to write out your work experience in terms of achievements and completed projects in each role.",
        "I see so many CV\u2019s where there\u2019s just a list of duties per job.",
        "A software developer could put \u201dwrote code, created unit tests\u201d on their CV and there would be no difference between them and literally the worst developer in the world.",

It\u2019s hard when you see very few jobs for the skills and education you have so you start applying to anything that you think is even a vague fit.",

All the tech articles were saying there would be tens of thousands of jobs over the next 10 years in Europe in Data Science. We would all be Data Scientists. I would have to train my cat in R just to keep up. (prrR, amirite?) Anyway, basically everyone and their cousin did degrees in Data Science and now \u2026 the market is flooded. In the meantime, algorithms have been created to handle a portion of the work which previously required humans and other use cases for data science just didn\u2019t materialise.",

Someone who happens to have a bit of background knowledge helpful for this particular company \u2013 this is where tailoring your CV can come in very handy. If you have worked on projects relevant to the role you\u2019re applying for \u2013 add them to your CV. People can\u2019t know what you don\u2019t tell them!",

If the market is oversubscribed; you\u2019ll need to heavily tailor your applications, get out and network, write convincing and targeting cover letters. If the advert or the recruiter are rubbish, you might have to do a bit of additional research on the company to find out if there\u2019s additional requirements or to chase up the recruiter.",
