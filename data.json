        "",
        "A Developer\u2019s First Steps in Finding a New Job, Part IV Read parts I, II, and III of this series if you missed them: We\u2019ve discussed knowing what it is you truly need in your career, working with recruiters, and understanding cost centers vs profit centers. This brings us to what I see as the final \u201cfirst step\u201d any developer should take in looking for a new job: overcoming imposter syndrome.",
        "The absolute hardest part of being a developer is the constant feeling that you aren\u2019t good enough. Impostor syndrome, the tendency to devalue your own work and become overwhelmed with the fear that you\u2019ll be exposed as a \u201cfraud,\u201d is probably the single largest mental roadblock across all developers. It tends to exacerbate any other anxiety related issues you might have and can send you to some dark places from time to time. I don\u2019t have good news here; it\u2019s simply part of the game. You have to be able to manage your own self image of failure. The idea of imposter syndrome is vital to understand as you begin your job search; you need to know that it\u2019s not your job to decide whether or not you can fill the role, it\u2019s the company's job to determine if you can fill the role. Keep that fact at the top of your mind every time you find yourself hesitating to apply for a job you\u2019d really love to do, but are afraid you\u2019re not good enough for.",
        "The first step in getting a grasp on this issue is to identify the source of it. In my experience the feeling that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing comes from two places: you see someone do something, and you can\u2019t figure out how they did it, or you set an expectation for yourself and fail to meet it. Once you\u2019ve established the source of your imposter syndrome, the second step is to set up a plan for overcoming the feeling. When you see someone do something and you can\u2019t figure out how they did it, you have to devote yourself to figuring it out. One of my most effective means of this is to simply email the person who did it and ask them how they did it. One of the greatest things about being a developer is that knowledge is not usually seen as something to conceal, but rather something to share. You\u2019ll be surprised how often there is a blog post detailing the thing, the reason it came to be needed, and the process that was used to figure out the solution. Or the person will just email you the equivalent because being asked to share your knowledge is also one of the most empowering feelings you can have as a developer. And after all\u2014developers sharing their knowledge is what Stack Overflow is built on. In any case, don\u2019t stop at knowing the high level details; make sure you actually implement it. Practicing the craft is the only way to truly know that you can do it. Just knowing the details of how it was done isn\u2019t enough. Be ready to devote yourself to a life of learning. The more devastating form of feeling like you\u2019re not good enough is when you set expectations for yourself and fail to meet them. In all likelihood your expectations of yourself were influenced by your boss or coworkers or teachers. Failing to meet their standards is extremely frightful because they are the ones responsible for judging your ability and awarding your compensation accordingly. It is extremely difficult to temper expectations in others without feeling like you\u2019re actually still failing. In my experience, most of my anxiety from this form is due to assumptions I made about what the expectations were, and those assumptions turned out to be false. Either my assumptions about the order to build things in was",
        "wrong or my guess as to what issues would come up when changing a system were wrong. Sometimes it\u2019s that I simply can\u2019t debug a problem because my expectation about the output is wrong, and I can\u2019t figure out why. The first thing I do in every case is try to explicitly state my assumptions and double check that I\u2019m on the same page with anyone else who should share these expectations. In the case that it\u2019s just me, I\u2019m a practitioner of rubber ducky debugging. This process is by no means a complete solution, however, and I still regularly go through the highs and lows of meeting and missing my own expectations.",
        "Remember: it\u2019s not your job to decide whether or not you can fill the role, it\u2019s the company's job to determine if you can fill the role. We tend to avoid any job we perceive as being above our skill set, without even giving the company a chance to evaluate us. Don\u2019t cut yourself off at the knees by only applying to jobs with titles that don't trigger imposter syndrome. Especially don\u2019t let insecurity\u00a0limit you to only searching for \u201centry level\u201d or \u201cjunior\u201d jobs. Often times jobs listed as entry level are not even actual developer jobs; they are analyst jobs (writing functional specs) or recruiter spam looking for new candidates to pass on to other companies. It\u2019s okay to apply to junior or entry level jobs, but don\u2019t limit your search to just those jobs-\u2014whatever your skill level. Take stock of your own self-evaluation and its inherent flaws, and remember that your only job is to represent yourself clearly and honestly, the best you can. If you\u2019re truly not qualified for a position, the company or recruiter will let you know that and you can move on. That concludes the foundation for finding a job that\u2019s a good fit for you. It\u2019s incredibly important to know yourself and what you\u2019re getting into. I cannot ignore the benefit of having two years of experience in this field, so if you\u2019re looking for your first job, I do encourage you to prioritize getting the experience over getting a lifelong job. But as soon as you have the experience, make sure you\u2019re constantly updating the answers to your questions and start the search. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this 4-part series and that it\u2019s given you some new tools in your job search. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of developers in job hunting and these are the steps that I\u2019ve determined are the most effective and important things any developer should do in looking for a new job.

        "EDIT: A little info from Glassdoor that I learned as part of my last job in marketing:",
        "The most recent review left, regardless of its score, is weighted at 80%. This is why after a negative review is left, a company will routinely leave an onslaught of positive reviews to counterweight the negative one. Glassdoor is trash.",
        "Also, some valuable nomenclature: an Active employer is one that uses the platform to respond to reviews and maybe some other trivial touchpoint engagement. An Engaged employer may be one that pays for the service. I'm inferring from the subtle threat in Glassdoor's own content.",
        "EDIT 2: Some people are pointing out that their algorithm had detected an identical review was submitted, which was the reason for my getting banned. Problem is, I didn't leave a second review. Like I said, the original review was live for 2 months and then it was removed for the reasons cited.",
        "Original: For the past few years, I've often defended Glassdoor as a useful resource as part of any job-seeker's overall job-seeking toolkit.",
        "About a year and a half ago, I interviewed with a company that had horrendous reviews. Literally, all 15 reviews were 1-star and for the same reasons. So in the interviews, I brought up some of the themes. The hiring manager, a decent man, admitted to all of it and said he was desperately and single-handedly trying to change those issues. So in this case, the negative reviews weren't a bunch of bitter employees; they were actual experiences and issues.",
        "I elected to join the company based on this honesty and the prospect of a challenge, and of course, it was exactly like how all those reviews had said it would be. It was awful. I was thankfully laid off due to COVID.",
        "After being laid off, I left a very detailed, thorough, cutting review that within a week of being posted, had 6 'helpful' upvotes or whatever. After two months, the review was removed suddenly for violating guidelines and so was every review I had ever written. Incredulous, I reached out to Glassdoor's content management team. They would not tell me exactly what the issue was, just that I was banned from participating in their community. Finally, a service manager emailed me to say they had some proprietary algorithm that had detected language that was in violation of Glassdoor's guidelines. To be clear, I didn't use any community guideline-violating language. Apparently, they detected an identical review had been written elsewhere.",
        "I have a close family member that works for Glassdoor. I spoke to this person and found out that a very recent strategic repositioning for Glassdoor is that they are trying to become a PR company of sorts, so they are focusing on brand management for companies. As a result, they are getting very aggressive with negative review-takedowns while allowing very obviously fraudulent positive reviews to remain the same.",
        "This same company from which I was laid off, from June-August, posted 10 5-star reviews, each of which was of similar length, all with just about the same thing to say. Cliches like, \"great culture\", \"build your skills\", \"enlightened management\", \"cool tech\", \"takes care of employees\". I reached out to Glassdoor and asked them to use their \"proprietary algorithm\" to see if there was any fraud in that content, to which they said no, there was no violation.",
        "So, what I'm getting at: with Glassdoor's supposed strategic pivot to brand management, it is becoming even less reliable than it was before.",

Thankfully, Glassdoor breaks it all down in a new study that analyzes how companies are hiring for AI-related positions. To create the study, Glassdoor looked at AI-related positions, top companies hiring AI talent, popular metro areas for AI work, and payscales of these roles across millions of job listings.",
        "The data might surprise you.",

However, these jobs comprise a fraction of the open AI roles on the platform with, predictably, software engineering, data science, and development roles dominating the list.",

However, there are also many technical sales, business development, product management, UX design and other roles being created by today\u2019s rising tide of AI in the workplace.\u201d",
        "The moral of the story? While AI might automate away some roles, it\u2019s already starting to create new ones, even in non-technical domains like marketing and sales. Soon, we predict, marketing and sales roles will either explicitly require familiarity with AI or be unable to be accomplished without some type of AI.

        "I\u2019ve been coding with Github Copilot for a few months now, and I regularly ask coding-related questions to ChatGPT and Claude. I\u2019ve been both amazed and frustrated at these LLMs\u2019 ability to answer questions in my daily workflow. Sometimes, they have saved me potentially hours of work, while other times they have led me astray, trying things that ultimately would not work. Why are these models so good in some cases and so bad in others? When are they helpful and when are they not?",
        "Note: the specific models I\u2019m referring to in this article are ChatGPT o1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.",
        "Overall, my experience using these AI tools has led me to the conclusion that:",
        "The more context-dependent a problem is, the less likely AI will help.",
        "What makes a problem context-dependent is exactly what it sounds like: how much context would a real person need in order to answer the same question.",
        "Here are some examples of problems that are NOT context-dependent.",
        "LLMs can still produce buggy code in these cases, but generally, with some guidance, or by pointing out that something doesn\u2019t work, the models will arrive at the right solution.",
        "These context-independent problems are the types of questions LLMs usually excel at.",
        "Let me illustrate with an example.",
        "I recently worked on a project where I had to write an algorithm to analyze whether a graph is trending upward.",
        "There are many shapes of upward trending graph: a linear increase, an exponential increase, a logarithmic growth, a staircase-like growth, or other nonlinear growth.",
        "I first asked ChatGPT and Claude to do a linear regression to determine if there exists a linear upward trend. Linear regression is a technique used to find the line of best fit for a linear set of data, and to determine how well that line indeed fits the data.",
        "Basically, I needed to translate the following formula for computing the slope and y-intercept into code:",
        "as well as the formula for computing the R-Squared value, or how well the line fits the data.",
        "Writing a linear regression algorithm is a very context-independent problem, and both ChatGPT and Claude did it perfectly.",
        "However, as the problem gets more context-specific, they started to falter.",
        "A real word application of trying to detect an upward trend is to determine whether a graph is indicative of a memory leak. For example, if we want to determine whether there is a goroutines leak in a go program, we need to look at the number of active goroutines over time.",
        "The example below is indicative of a memory leak in goroutines because the number of goroutines increases exponentially until the machine eventually runs out of memory and experiences a out-of-memory kill.",
        "To continue on the previous example of analyzing whether a graph is trending upward, I asked ChatGPT to detect whether a graph is growing exponentially. This time, I gave it more context:",
        "\u201cI want to analyze a timeseries graph to determine if the graph displays exponential growth. Can you write a function that takes in 2 arrays. The first is list of timestamps in milliseconds since epoch. The second is a list of y-values at those timestamps. The function should return whether the graph is growing exponentially, and how confident it is.\u201d",
        "Note that I provided the context that the list of x-coordinates are in milliseconds since epoch.",
        "How did ChatGPT do?",
        "ChatGPT\u2019s merely gave me an algorithm for exponential regression.",
        "Exponential regression is a technique to determine whether a graph is increasing exponentially. It works by transforming the data into a linear form by taking the natural log of the y-values. By taking ln(y), an exponential relationship becomes a linear one.",
        "ChatGPT did give me the correct algorithm for exponential regression. Similar to linear regression, doing a simple exponential regression is a context-independent problem.",
        "However, here, we have the additional context that this is not just any graph, but a timeseries graph where the x-axis values are in milliseconds since epoch. ChatGPT failed to take this context into account.",
        "As a result, when I ran the algorithm against real timeseries data, like the data for the goroutines example, it did not work. This is because the x-axis values are in milliseconds since epoch and thus the numbers are HUGE!",
        "A one hour time difference in milliseconds in the x-axis is 60 *60 * 1000 = 3600000. However, if the y-axis values go from 200 to 20000, the log of the difference between the min and max is only 4.6.",
        "ln(200) = 5.3",
        "ln(20000) = 9.9",
        "As a result, when running a linear regression on the transformed y-axis values, the slope returned could be extremely small, and would not pass a reasonable slope threshold for linear increase like 0.01.",
        "Luckily I still remembered some math from college, and I remembered that scaling the horizontal axis is something that might need to get done. Despite telling ChatGPT the context of timeseries in milliseconds since epoch, it did not automatically think about scaling.",
        "Additionally, even when I deliberately asked about scaling, the model gave the wrong answer.",
        "The model said \u201ceither strategy can help\u201d. However, simply shifting the timestamp will not affect the slope obtained from linear regression. The timestamps must be scaled down. Thus, the correct answer is \u201cboth steps must be used\u201d instead of \u201ceither strategy can help.\u201d",
        "Some prompts did give the right answer of using both steps, but the fact that some prompts work and other don\u2019t is indicative of the difficulty that LLMs have when it comes to analyzing context.",
        "Claude did slightly better, it included scaling in its algorithm:",
        "However, in its answer, it did not explain the reasoning for scaling and why it chose 1000. Even when I asked about it, the answer failed to mention the relevance in making sure we get a slope that can be meaningfully positive when performing linear regression with log values.",
        "Claude\u2019s answer was mostly related to seconds being more conventional and intuitive:",
        "Timestamps are in milliseconds since epoch, but working in seconds is more conventional and intuitive for growth rate analysis",
        "So what does this all mean in the day-to-day life of an engineer like myself?",
        "Most hard problems I encounter in my day-to-day life are very context-dependent. A bug or issue that appears as you\u2019re coding in a codebase is usually very context-dependent. For example, I\u2019ve rarely had AI help me fix a styling issue or achieve a tricky-to-implement user interaction. This is because whether a CSS or Javascript suggestion works or not is very dependent on what else is on the page or how the many existing components are structured.",
        "Therefore, in today\u2019s world, LLMs are more like assistants than replacements. The more domain knowledge one needs to do their job, the more this statement becomes true.",
        "If a question (e.g. write a algorithm that does so-and-so) has been answered before, and it has been answered many times by many people, chances are, the LLMs will be able to answer it accurately.",
        "However, if a problem has not been answered before (e.g. implement a tricky user interaction within the context of your existing codebase with its existing layout), chances are, the current generation of LLMs will struggle as well.",

        "But light is an essential design element of a play. It can change the scenery. Look how the spotlights focus on the main characters and hide the rest of the scenery. White cold lights outline the warm yellow lantern. Without the technician, the stage would stay in the dark. All the work done backstage is important for the customer. It\u2019s the same in the software industry.",
        "In my career, I worked on many of those \u201cBackstage projects\u201d. I transferred an entire infrastructure to the cloud. I migrated MySQL database to No-SQL. I split a monolithic app into micro-services. To value this work you have to understand why I did it, and why they were customer impacting.",
        "Yes, the customer doesn\u2019t care if you use cloud solutions or physical hardware. However, migrating to the cloud, allowed us to scale down at night when traffic was low. In 6 months we saved 25% of cost on hardware. It also made our deployment process easier, saving developers time. Instead of releasing once a week we moved to continuous deployment. That\u2019s valuable for our customers, they get features quickly. Once we were in the cloud our old MySQL database was growing way to fast. We were using the biggest cloud instance available. Replication was a nightmare, engineers were paged 10 times a week because of issues related to the database. Migrating to No-SQL was a challenge. But we were on the verge of collapsing. So it became a priority. The successful migration allowed the service to scale by 10x.",
        "By now you should be convinced that backstage projects are important. They make your platform more stable. They allow faster iterations. You pay legacy debt and avoid future costs. For each \u201cBackstage \u201c it\u2019s usually easy to identify how they bring value to your customer. Use as much data as you can to your claim.",
        "Those projects are ambitious. As your service is used by customers you cannot afford downtime. Try to change the engine of your car as it\u2019s running on the highway. Every heavy migration requires proper planning. An engineer operates dry-run. The lightning technician rehearses with the actors. An engineer builds script to migrate automatically. A lightning technician leverage console automation. One on a button and it runs a pre-recorded sequence of light events. This avoids manual errors.",
        "It may not feel as fancy as working on a new framework or a cool feature. But they represent exceptional challenges. They move you out of your comfort zone and make you better a better engineer.",
        "You have to think about what can go wrong. Anticipate and mitigate known unknowns. In my team, we call those projects \u201cOperational work\u201d. They include support, on-call, refactoring, paying technical debt. We take ownership really seriously. If our team pushes a feature live, it\u2019s our responsibility to maintain it. That includes hardware provisioning, metrics alarming. Checking spotlights before the show, and replacing faulty ones is crucial. And for some reasons, software engineers tend to despite this maintenance work.",
        "As I was trapped in this dark lighting room during a show, I learned a last important lesson. There is only one reason that will make you visible. If something goes wrong.",
        "Imagine Benedict Cumberbatch in Hamlet at the Barbican Theatre. The audience is captivated by the famous monologue. When all the spotlights turn off. You can be sure, everyone will look around for a guilty technician.",
        "It\u2019s a team effort. The main actor trusts people working backstage to play their part. Same for a heavy migration. Nobody cares until you break the production server. You have to do it without impacting the delivery of new features. If you do your job correctly nobody will ever know. There is no individual reward for doing it right. Your job is literally to stay invisible. As an engineer, we should enjoy being in the dark. As a team, we should recognize lightning technicians, as anonymous heroes. They are a crucial part of our workforce. As a manager, we have to help them achieve goals and grow as engineers. We want to make their life easier, and praise even dull operational work, that contribute to a healthy product and happy team. If you do that you may start to see your engineers glow in the dark.",

    "30: What nobody at Uni will tell you about being a Software Developer - Shine Solutions Group": [
        "I wasn\u2019t sure what my first day at Shine would look like. I looked for some blog posts that resembled this one for some insights but I figured everyone\u2019s experience is different. I hadn\u2019t worked in this industry before, and my work experience at a laptop repair shop didn\u2019t really count. The only relevant experience I had was the industry project I did in my final year of study and that turned out to be very valuable. I knew I would be thrown into the deep end and have to learn quickly. Since day one, I\u2019ve been surrounded by great mentors, helping with code reviews, best practices to follow, great book suggestions and general insights into how this business works. Anyway, I think enough time has passed now to reflect on this year.",
        "On my first day I started off with some admin stuff setting up my accounts and getting my work environment setup then I met my team over a coffee downstairs. My team leader filled me in on the client we were working with and what languages and tools I would have to learn. He asked me what my favourite platform or tool was and I said \u201cAndroid\u201d. He said \u201cgreat, you won\u2019t be using it here\u201d. So I said goodbye to Android.",
        "I was given some documentation and blogs to read like this, related to my first task. This covered Google Cloud Platform services: BigQuery and Cloud Dataflow. This was my first interaction with GCP and my understanding of it was simply \u201cGoogle\u2019s version of AWS\u201d. I was fortunate to have covered Amazon Web Services during my studies but I was aware we didn\u2019t go deep. What it provided rather was a feeling of familiarity to what AWS could be used for. I knew what a lot of the services were and how they could be used alongside other services but in labs we never went further in execution past spinning up an EC2 instance. Also AWS has a constantly growing list of products and services, too many to cover.",
        "",
        "I did the first part of my task using a shell script and the Google Cloud Storage command line tool. It was either that (extending an existing script) or using Python and an API to replace that script altogether. Despite not being well versed in either language, the shell script seemed the more straightforward option so I went with that. I saw the codebase that I would be adding to. I hadn\u2019t contributed to an existing codebase of this size before. There appeared to be a lot of files with different formats and a mixture of scripts and Java all connected \u2013 quite a change in scale and complexity from uni.",
        "",
        "This also marked the first time I had seen a separate staging and a production environment in use. My development prior to this had all been local development and execution. I had read about about different environments (staging and production) but now they had some weight behind them after seeing a real-world example. I learned that we deploy first to staging before anything goes into production, with staging being a close approximation to production. This way we may find a missing dependency or bug when we move from our local development environment to staging, well before it actually goes into production.",
        "I also saw some cool automation set up by my team. When you merge a feature branch into the master branch, it kicks off a Jenkins job that runs the tests, builds and deploys into staging. All of this is integrated with Slack in a dedicated channel so you can see: when a merge request has been accepted, some code review comments on the changes, see that it built successfully or failed some of its tests. I\u2019ve seen some great examples of automation thus far. Why should you do these repetitive things manually when you can save time and work on something else instead.",
        "As I had expected, I found the industry project I did in my final year of study to be the most useful in terms of preparing me. The project was for a maritime training company which made simulation rigs consisting of an array of screens surrounding the user for immersion and some hardware controllers to interact with software that would control a marine vessel within a simulation. The use case was for maritime training much like a flight simulator for training pilots. \u00a0Our task was to make an app for an Android tablet that could be used to replace the hardware controllers that they built individually for every rig. The hardware was quite costly and easier to just simply digitise it.",
        "The project covered a wide range of skills and technologies. We practiced Agile development and had roles within our project team, having a stand up twice a week in a meeting room (similar to how we do it here at Shine). The requirements stated Android to be the primary platform and no one in the group had any experience developing mobile applications. \u00a0I had previously dabbled with GUI programming using C++. It seemed like the most relevant experience anyone had so I put my hand up to start development using Android Studio and try to teach everyone else as I went. \u00a0It was a great opportunity to force myself to learn a new technology in an unstructured fashion to get the job done. \u00a0It seemed daunting to pick up a new technology in such a short amount of time but I have found that to be the norm in this industry \u2013 there appears to be a new popular language or framework springing up every day.",
        "",
        "",
        "Simulation looked something like this.",
        "Another thing the industry project provided for me was experience in problem solving. We had an interesting problem of making the user\u2019s interaction with the tablet\u2019s touch screen equate to action in the simulation software running on a PC \u2013 controlling the vessel. \u00a0However, we had no access to the simulation\u00a0software\u2019s source code and no API to use. We defined two paths we could take to find a solution. The first involved replacing one of their DLL (Dynamic-link Library) files with our own and the second involved spoofing a COM port using a virtual one.\u00a0Both paths were quite hacky due to our limitations and\u00a0ultimately we ran out of time. But it\u2019s fine \u2013 getting that to work was considered a bonus on top of what we had already completed.",
        "Luckily we were taught Version Control during the project and a bunch of project management tools like Jira and Confluence that I was pleased to find we use here. Moving to IntelliJ as my go to IDE was easy because Android Studio is built on IntelliJ so they look and feel the same. Again that meant one less new tool to learn.",
        "In one of my subjects we covered Docker and even though I used it to create containers with functionality, I feel like I hadn\u2019t seen a great use case for it until I was at Shine. I like it\u2019s use as an environment to run unit tests where all the dependencies can be defined and provided or to use it as a sandbox to use a particular version of a library or language that you don\u2019t want to install on your local environment.",
        "When I was learning database fundamentals and SQL I was unsure whether I\u2019d ever use SQL. I was told it would be beneficial if you wanted to become a database administrator which didn\u2019t seem like my path. However, in our team we use BigQuery daily which uses SQL. I recall a friend at uni telling me \u201cdon\u2019t worry about databases and SQL\u201d. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t listen to him \u2013 all those group by, order by and left joins are coming in handy now.",
        "",
        "One thing I think my course really glossed over was unit testing and it\u2019s importance. It was covered alongside usability testing as testing in general. We saw an example of a testing framework and how the syntax worked but I missed the point of what makes a good unit test, which is important when it\u2019s so easy to write unit tests that don\u2019t accomplish anything. I don\u2019t think they sold the argument for unit testing. I spent some time playing catch up on this one when I was asked where my unit tests were. The usefulness is obvious after you have written them, in particular they can alert you to broken functionality you may have unknowingly introduced when making changes to existing code.",
        "I\u2019ve seen many people write that one of the most enduring parts of getting a degree is learning how to learn. I agree with that. The industry project in particular taught me how to self learn, focussing on only the relevant bits as you need them. Of course the degree also covered the fundamentals that are essential \u2013 eg. how one programming language works in depth so that you can move to another language with less friction (Java to C++ was similar enough). I\u2019m glad I covered React during my studies, because it would make another JS framework like Angular easier to pick up if I am to use it in future.",
        "Being surrounded by helpful and experienced developers, I was pretty conscious of when to ask for help. There\u2019s times where the answer can simply be searched online or worked out after short amount of time. That\u2019s an occasion when you don\u2019t need to ask for help because you would most likely be wasting someone else\u2019s time \u2013 in that case they\u2019d Google it in front you. But if it means you\u2019re wasting your time figuring something out for hours on your own when it could have taken five minutes with someone explaining it to you, then that\u2019s a good time to ask. Most likely someone has encountered a problem just like yours before and can save you some time.",
        "Since starting at Shine, there\u2019s been multiple times where I\u2019ve been given a task which at the time either seems too large or intimidating. That\u2019s all in context to what I\u2019ve encountered previously. It\u2019s helped me since day one to have a positive attitude about the next thing I\u2019m working on. \u201cI haven\u2019t used this language before and haven\u2019t even heard of this new AWS service\u2026 Alright, I\u2019ll figure this out\u201d.",

        "\ud83d\udc77\u2642\ufe0f Celebrating Labor Day: Reflecting on the Journey to Secure a Remote Software Engineering Role \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\n\nThis Labor Day, I\u2019m taking a moment to appreciate the evolving landscape of work, particularly in the world of software engineering. As we celebrate the contributions of workers everywhere, it\u2019s also a time to reflect on the unique challenges many of us face in securing and thriving in remote roles.\n\nThe shift to remote work has opened doors for talent across the globe, allowing software engineers to work from wherever they feel most inspired. However, this opportunity comes with its own set of hurdles:\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Intense Competition: The remote job market is fiercely competitive. With candidates applying from all corners of the world, standing out requires not just technical excellence, but also the ability to showcase your communication skills, self-discipline, and adaptability.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Finding the Right Fit: Remote roles demand a unique work environment and culture. It\u2019s not just about the job description but about finding a team and a company that values flexibility, fosters collaboration across time zones, and supports continuous learning.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Navigating the Hiring Process: Remote interviews often include technical challenges, coding assessments, and multiple rounds of video interviews. Proving your skills remotely can be daunting, especially when trying to convey your passion and expertise through a screen.\n\nBut despite these challenges, the rewards of securing a remote role are immense. The freedom to work from anywhere, the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams, and the work-life balance that many of us strive for are all within reach.\n\n\ud83d\udcaa My advice? Embrace the journey. Keep honing your skills, build a strong online presence, and don\u2019t be afraid to network and reach out to others in the field. The right opportunity is out there, and with persistence and preparation, you can find your place in this new world of work.\n\nHappy Labor Day to all the hardworking professionals out there, especially those navigating the challenges of remote work. Let\u2019s continue to push boundaries, innovate, and support each other in this evolving landscape.\n\n#LaborDay #RemoteWork #SoftwareEngineering #JobSearch #CareerGrowth",

Plus, I had the honor of moderating a session with the incomparable\u00a0Greg Johnson about Intuit\u2019s evolution from product to platform and the critical role of AI in driving this transformation.\n\nWhile sharing key lessons from Intuit's journey, including how to move from misalignment to orchestration, Greg dropped gems about his career path, the power of knowing the difference between your defined job and the roles you take on, and how leaning into AI can help level the playing field for Black entrepreneurs and small business owners in general. To say nothing of the rich Q&A that followed where I got to share a few golden nuggets of my own.\n\nIt was an inspiring few days and a wonderful reminder as we head into the Thanksgiving season of how much I have to be grateful for, beginning with a job that allows me to play so many roles, and the gift of being part of a rich, tradition of Black people blazing trails in every possible way. Huge thanks to AFROTECH for creating the space, and the team at Intuit for all the support and making this possible.\n\nLooking forward to all the great talent we met making their way our team at Intuit and others in the tech world. In the age of AI diversity isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s crucial to avoid replicating bias and to drive innovation and finding qualified, diverse, and specifically Black talent isn\u2019t hard.

        "\ud83d\ude80 An Unfiltered Look into the Black Experience in Technology with Natilik \ud83d\ude80\n\nEarlier today , I joined an unforgettable panel session at Natilik , where we went deep into a conversation that tech needs. Not just surface-level, not performative\u2014real. We talked openly about the Black experience in the tech sector, the barriers still standing, and the moves each of us can make to dismantle them, starting today.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 This wasn\u2019t just another \u2018diversity\u2019 talk. We were in a room filled with allies, leaders, and rising stars who truly care and are ready to act. What do organisations actually need to do to change the game? How can individuals contribute\u2014not just in public, but privately, consistently, and boldly? And for allies: how do we step up to support, not just when it\u2019s easy or expected, but always?\n\n\ud83c\udf89 A massive thank you to Natilik for creating this safe, courageous space. It takes real leadership to go beyond the buzzwords and set a standard for others in the industry. Our partnership with Natilik goes beyond events\u2014it\u2019s about action. Together, we\u2019re giving young Black talent the access, mentorship, and industry insights they deserve through school visits, mentorships, and exclusive industry days. This isn\u2019t a one-off\u2014it\u2019s a journey, a commitment to change that grows stronger with every step.\n\n\ud83c\udf31 To everyone in that room, and to all of you reading this who want to see the tech industry reflect the diverse world we live in\u2014let\u2019s keep pushing. Your involvement matters. Whether you\u2019re a CEO, a DEI leader, a young person breaking into the industry, or simply someone who wants to be part of the solution\u2014there\u2019s a place for you in this movement.\n\nLet\u2019s level the playing field, open the doors, and make a lasting impact.

        "A story for Black History Month..\n\nWe once had a cleaner, he would come in periodically to clean the office, he was an older black man, probably in his early 50's. \n\nOne day, he came in and me and Azzees were still in the office working at our desks. He started cleaning, we had our usual conversation, abit of banter and abit about life generally, then every so often he would pause and just look at us, and when I'd catch his eye, he'd look away and go back to what he was doing. \n\nEventually, he stopped what he was doing, walked up to our desks and said: \n\n\"I don't see this much you know, this is different\"\n\nMe and Azzees were confused, we looked at each other and then looked back at him\n\nHe said it again, \"I mean it, you really don't see this much\" \n\nI responded with, \"what do you mean?\"\n\nHe said: \"You know, you two, two black founders in an office in Central London, I'm used to being in offices where the owners are often white, or Asian, but definitely not black, this is beautiful to see, well done to you both, it's nice to see things are changing\" \n\nIt was a really heart warming moment for us, but also a reminder of the influence you can have just by being you. \n\nWe never set out to be \"black founders\" - we just set out to solve a problem, and that has lead to people young and old being inspired by what we do. This Black History Month, I encourage you to celebrate the black people out there stepping out of their comfort zones and doing something different. So I'm going to take this opportunity to shout out a few other black social entrepreneurs doing brilliant work: \n\nDr. Kenny Imafidon MBE Burphy Zumu Lydia Amoah FRSA Jay Richards George Imafidon MBE Julian Boaitey Kike Oniwinde Agoro Andy Ayim MBE Dr. William Adoasi (Hons) \n\nWe're excited to be speaking at a few events this BHM and sharing insights on building a diverse team and working with young people from ethnically diverse backgrounds \n\nIf you're looking for a speaker for your event, get in touch: carl@2-3degrees.com\n2-3 Degrees Azzees Minott \n\n\ud83d\ude0e #blackfounder #blackbusiness #socialenterprise #BHM #blackhistorymonth",

I was truly inspired by the incredible talent, passion, and drive within our community that often goes overlooked.\n\nThe sense of brotherhood/sisterhood between the panelists was powerful, and their dedication to uplifting and inspiring Black professionals was enlightening. Being in these spaces, surrounded by people who share similar challenges and aspirations, really reinforced the importance of visibility and community. It\u2019s not just about showing up for your business but also showing up for each other.\n\nThese rooms are so important because they give us a platform to learn from others who have faced similar obstacles, and more importantly, to share strategies on how to navigate and thrive in various environments. Feeling safe and understood in a professional setting is something many of us don\u2019t always experience, and it makes all the difference in building confidence and connections.\n\nI left feeling motivated, with new insights on how to approach my own work and a deeper appreciation for the power of collaboration within our community. Being in the room is more than just attending\u2014it\u2019s about taking the opportunity to learn, connect, and grow.\n\n\nA big congratulations to BTF\u00ae and to Dr. Raphael Sofoluke UK Black Business Show  for these successful events and the impact you are making within the community!\n\n\n#BlackBusinessWeek #BTF2024 #CommunityOverCompetition #RepresentationMatters #ProfessionalGrowth #VisibilityMatters #DiversityAndInclusion\n#BlackExcellence\n#NetworkingOpportunities\n#LeadershipDevelopment\n#CollaborationIsKey\n#Empowerment\n#MentorshipMatters\n#BlackProfessionals\n#BusinessGrowth\n#StrategicNetworking",

        "Listen",
        "Share",
        "Meet Angel Benito, CTO at Zartis, a software engineering consulting company. Angel has an unusual vision of what a manager should be, and explains how Zartis doesn\u2019t believe in traditional managers. He also shares how Madrid, Spain, stacks up as a potential place to work in the tech sector and how being CTO of a consulting company works.",
        "How did your career lead you to Zartis?",
        "This is an interesting story. I started in 2006 as an intern in IT. I went up the ladder from intern to junior, mid, senior, tech lead, then solutions architect, and so on. My career involves working as part of a team, and when I was about 25 years old, I was asked to lead teams of people in their forties who had 15 years more experience than me, which was quite challenging. I used to work at Siemens, leading an emergency management product for nine years. I was leading the technical area, part of the product roadmap and its strategy. It was a mix between technical and product leadership. I was also participating in sales meetings.",
        "After that, I was a little bit tired of managing people and was looking for a more technical role. I was stuck for several years in one product \u2014 one technology \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want to get rusty. That\u2019s why I wanted to join just a technical role. My people management skills are well-developed, but the technical part has to stay up-to-date.",
        "Because of that, Zartis called me to join as a solutions architect, and I accepted, as it was a technical role not involving people management. But I like helping people, it is in my nature, so I was eventually promoted to head of engineering and then CTO. I went through all the steps.",
        "I feel those managerial roles are being glorified while they don\u2019t necessarily mean a promotion. It\u2019s a completely different job.",
        "Yes, it is quite interesting. The industry asks you to choose tech or management. We don\u2019t do that at Zartis. I don\u2019t believe in just managers. When you hire very senior people, you need people to help them facilitate their success. In Zartis we use a servant leadership approach for that. It\u2019s easier the technical part. Machines are easier to manage than people, for sure.",
        "We are organizing things at Zartis very differently. We don\u2019t aim for people to become managers, but rather to become the best of themselves, reinforcing their technical capabilities. You can become a principal, solutions architect, and then enterprise architect. It is a technical path that doesn\u2019t involve management if you want to.",
        "If you have the skills and time to help people be successful, you want to work on conflict resolution and emotional intelligence, you can have an assignment to be a manager. In the technical path, there will be lots of stakeholders to manage and your persuasion skills will be very important. Look for your \u201cikigai,\u201d which is a Japanese concept about finding \u2018your reason for being\u2019. A perfect mix what you\u2019re good at, what people want you to do and be paid for, where you are useful and what you love. People need to learn what their ikigai is.",
        "Is there something different about being CTO of a software house? You don\u2019t work on a single project. You\u2019re the first CTO from that kind of company I\u2019ve interviewed.",
        "When I was asked to become the CTO, since we don\u2019t have a software product, my answer was \u201cdo we need a CTO?\u201d I am the technical representative of a lot of people. I need to provide all the services to people inside the company (value, culture, tone, proper training, mentoring, a great teach community, etc.) and set the technical strategy for the company. Picking the right technologies we decide to focus on is also important and Zartis is a tech company, tech needs to be involve in the stratey. My role as CTO at Zartis is also to be the CTO of other companies as contractor. I\u2019m trying to help other companies with my role leading the high level consultancy.",
        "I help decide which projects and customers are good from a technical point of view, and which ones are not. We have very senior people working on high-quality projects. The only way to retain people in tech is a good environment and interesting technologies.",
        "Now, we are expanding our business for more high-level consultancy, helping companies from a strategical point of view. We act as experts in terms of structure, processes, products, strategy, etc. Not only that, but we are also trying to think about investing in our products, which is a normal startup CTO role. We have an incubation division to start our own ideas. It\u2019s a new thing, so we\u2019ll see how it goes. It\u2019s not only for our internal usage, but for problems we see within our clients.",
        "You\u2019re based out of Madrid. Can you please share some insights on the tech scene in Spain?",
        "It\u2019s a mini-London in terms of culture. It is very open; everyone who comes here is welcome. From the technical point of view, as the capital of Spain, it is the main hub. From the cultural point of view, the good thing about Madrid is that it is never sleeping. There are always places full of people.",
        "For the technical sector, Spain in general has a culture of being more conservative regarding job-switching, so we are more stable in our work. For Zartis, it\u2019s good as we build a great culture and people stay for 5 or 6 years. For the sector in general, it is not great as people take fewer risks. We have some entrepreneurial spirit in Madrid, but not as much as in other important cities in the world.",
        "Any fun or horror stories to share from your career?",
        "Millions! A fun story\u2026 I would say when working remotely, there are funny stories about screen sharing. One teammate shared a screen with a customer, and I was giving inputs on Slack during the presentation. He didn\u2019t deactivate the popups, so everyone saw my comments. A bit embarrassing, but it\u2019s fine. People got over it.",
        "One time, when I was sharing with someone, instead of sharing just the tab, I shared the whole screen and exposed additional information that I didn\u2019t mean to share.",
        "For a horror story, in an emergency management system where I was for nine years, I had stressful moments. When I was working at Atos the 112 emergency number wasn\u2019t working. I was responsible for it, and it was really stressful. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t our fault; it was the phone provider in Spain, not our system. I remember those 30 minutes to be extremely stressful. Nobody answering emergency services for people in need is the worst nightmare!",

        "Based on reviewing hundreds of resumes per year and researching a book, here are the seven pieces of advice for engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "In an ideal world, you wouldn\u2019t need a resume. You\u2019d have a recruiter reach out to you along the lines of: \u201cYour ex-colleague Bob spoke extremely highly of your time working at Stack Overflow. Our company is growing, and we\u2019d love to talk with you. Do you have time to chat with a few members of the team next Wednesday?\u201d",
        "However, in reality, you will, at some point, find yourself applying at a company where Bob is not there to vouch for you, so you cannot skip through the process of being evaluated before the team will talk to you.",
        "I\u2019ve been a hiring manager for numerous companies and typically go through hundreds of resumes per year. I\u2019ve also researched the topic of writing a developer resume that represents you well while writing the book The Tech Resume Inside Out: What a Good Developer Resume Looks Like. For the book, I ended up talking with two dozen recruiters and hiring managers at the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Transferwise, and other well-known companies.",
        "Based on that experience, here are the seven pieces of advice that I give to engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "Many engineers assume their resume should just contain highlights of their employment history. They\u2019ve seen other people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles and seen a few resumes. Most of these look like this, and companies must be interested in what you did. Right?",
        "Wrong.",
        "The goal of your resume is to sell you enough to get a recruiter phone call and continue the process. This is a very different goal from telling your entire professional story. Your goal should be to showcase to the company why you\u2019re a good fit for the position they are recruiting for.",
        "This means highlighting parts of your resume that show you being a great match for a specific position. Tuning it to fit the opening might be as simple as changing the order of things or adding specific details that only this position might find interesting. When you have lots of experience, this might mean cutting less relevant parts short and leaving irrelevant things off.",
        "Here\u2019s how a typical hiring manager and recruiter will read your resume:",
        "1. Quick scan. They\u2019ll do a short scan of a few seconds, gathering all key information. Your location, years of experience, languages and technologies, position names, company names, and anything else that stands out.",
        "2. Second read. Assuming this first scan matches what they\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll re-read your resume, top to bottom, reading the content you wrote. However, if, in the quick scan, it didn\u2019t seem that you have what the position needs, there will be no second read.",
        "You should choose a resume format that helps highlight the key information the recruiter or hiring manager looks for in that first scan. A good resume template follows these principles:",
        "Why bother spending the time finding a good template? The less effort it is for a recruiter to get the key information in the quick scan, the more time they\u2019ll have to look at other parts of your resume. Here\u2019s a resume template you could use\u2014I created this template for the book, and it satisfies all the above requirements. Of course, there are many others to choose from, and you can also design your own.",
        "The recruiter or hiring manager will read your resume top to bottom. You\u2019ll want the most relevant parts to be at the top and less relevant ones towards the bottom. When you have lots of experience, it\u2019s fine to go beyond just one page: just make sure that everything relevant is still on the first page.",
        "When you\u2019re a new grad or bootcamp grad, hiring managers usually care about experience in this order:",
        "When you have work experience, the way a recruiter reads your resume changes. Here is what will be most relevant:",
        "With lots of work experience, you start to stand out from the crowd of applicants. At the same time, you\u2019ll probably have more experience than would fit on a page or two. In this case, a one-page resume is no longer a must-have, but you\u2019ll want to be more concise in your earlier experience: especially when that experience is not as relevant. Here\u2019s the order you could consider structuring your resume:",
        "It can feel painful to cut away some of your experience from your resume. But keep in mind your goal: it\u2019s to have that recruiter call. I collaborated with a systems administrator turned developer who had 20 years of experience. Ten years ago, they went back to college to get a computer science degree. Their original resume had all 20 years of experience listed: non-CS degree, ten years working as a systems admin, CS degree, ten years as a developer. The first ten years did not add much professionally to their resume: they ended up removing this, but still keeping their first, non-CS degree there. The new resume was cleaner, and they saw more callbacks with it.",
        "While you don\u2019t need to remove old positions, you should aim to reduce detail mentions significantly, except if they would add something very valuable for your current job application.",
        "Keep regional and cultural differences in mind as you craft your resume. For example, in most of the US, a one-page resume is the norm for developers with less than a few years\u2019 experience. Even more senior people aim to fit everything important on the first page. In most of Europe, resumes of two pages are common, and some hiring managers actually prefer to read longer resumes for senior people. Whatever the length, make sure you communicate the relevant parts first. Use the space wisely, elaborating more on your experiences and results that relate to the position you are applying for.",
        "Positions hiring for generalist software engineers will want to see some evidence that you have worked with a few technologies. For these places, it\u2019s a good sign if you\u2019ve mastered multiple technologies. Positions hiring for specific technologies will want to confirm that you did meaningful work with those technologies.",
        "There are a few ways you could make it clear what languages and technologies you are proficient with:",
        "1. Have a separate section for \u201clanguages and technologies\u201d on the first page of your resume.",
        "In this section, list out areas you are proficient with. Don\u2019t bother specifying your expertise level: the hiring manager will assume you know these well enough if you listed them. An example of this approach can look like this:",
        "2. Call out languages and technologies that you used as part of your work experience.",
        "An alternative to the previous approach is to mention the tools you used in each position. This gives more context on when you used these technologies or frameworks and what problems you solved using them. You could just list these out separately at the end of each position like this:",
        "However, I recommend \u201cweaving in\u201d the languages and technologies to the description itself. This both reads better, and you can give even more context:",
        "One thing I wish more resumes had is specifics. The majority of CVs I\u2019ve read tend to list responsibilities, what work was assigned, or have a hand-wavy explanation of the work. Here\u2019s an example of a resume snippet that recruiters and hiring managers see all too commonly:",
        "While the person writing these details probably felt they were showcasing the work they were doing\u2014the hiring manager gets little to no context on the specifics of the work. To stand out, be specific. To be specific, follow this approach:",
        "Having a \u201cmaster\u201d resume and tailoring it for every position you apply for is a great strategy. The tailoring doesn\u2019t have to be drastic. However, if you are applying for a company where the job listing lists the stack as React and Node\u2014and you have experience with these, among other languages\u2014moving these up front could be a small change with a big impact. Similarly, if you\u2019ve done work similar to what the position is asking for, having these bullet points listed first are all good ways to grab the attention of the person reading the resume earlier.",
        "One last thing I need to call out, as developers seeking jobs bring it up: the application tracking systems (ATS), and robots \u201crejecting\u201d your resume. This is false. Your resume will be read by a human. At tech companies, ATSes do not \u201creject\u201d resumes, and \u201crobot rejection\u201d does not exist in tech. Be wary of any resource that claims this is true: they are probably using the tactic to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt as an incentive for you to buy their service. I\u2019m saying this both as a hiring manager who has worked with ATSes and as an author who interviewed recruiters at all major tech companies. I asked them about robot rejections; they all confirmed that they have not seen or heard of such a practice.",
        "Applying for a job does not end with having a good resume. A few things can greatly help your job search: referrals, cover letters, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.",
        "Employee referrals are the best way to increase your chances of hearing back from a company. If you have a strong referral, much of the above becomes less relevant. How do you get a referral? You ask. Ask around in your network to see who is hiring. Ask on public forums where tech professionals gather like Twitter or LinkedIn\u2014potentially even Blind. You can try and reach out for a cold referral: but if you do, add context on why you think you are a great fit for a job and offer an easy way out for the person to not refer you if they do not feel comfortable doing so.",
        "Cover letters are a coin toss. For larger companies, these places usually either don\u2019t ask for one, or don\u2019t pay much attention to it. At smaller firms and startups, where hiring managers are likely to read resumes and cover letters, it\u2019s a better investment to spend time on this. Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. Don\u2019t repeat your resume: add additional details that make your case stronger as to why you are a good fit for the position you are applying to.",
        "Even if you are not looking for a job today, invest in growing your professional network. The larger your network, the easier you can get referrals from people who know the professional \u201cyou.\" To grow your network, build genuine relationships with others, help people, and make yourself visible. You don\u2019t have to do this on social media: you can start right now at your workplace, within and outside your team.",
        "LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow are all sites where having an up-to-date profile will greatly help your job search. Keep your LinkedIn up to date: it\u2019s a good idea to refresh it as you write your resume. For GitHub, consider creating a GitHub README to present yourself and your key projects more effectively. Make sure projects you mention in your resume or those that you pin to your GitHub profile also have READMEs that share what the project is about. On Stack Overflow, tailor your Developer Story to make it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to find you with relevant opportunities.",

        "Friendly suggestion: before deleting the old feature in the future, perhaps you should roll out the new feature, and observe the conversion rate. If everyone keeps using the old feature, either the update wasn\u2019t communicated well, or everyone prefers the old way.\nI\u2019m really scratching my head as to why Asana broke userland for this.\nThanks for all the hard work, though!",

        "I\u2019m really disappointed by this product decision. I admire you being bold and taking such a huge risk in user experience, but this was a terrible decision. One of the major reasons I bring people to Asana from different teams, is exactly because creating sections was so convenient.",
        "The new workflow really speeds me down. I am honestly sad I am part of the 10% this rolled out to.",

        "+1 that using TAB+N instead of a colon while seemingly a small change can result in a tangible slow down. For a productivity app, that\u2019s exceptionally painful.",
        "Not being able to convert existing tasks to a section is a MAJOR miss.",
        "Hi, all!",
        "Sorry that this feels like such a usability issue - here at Asana we use our product more heavily than almost any customer (as you might imagine!) and retraining ourselves to use Tab+N instead of a colon has been quite a hurdle (at least for me  ). We totally understand how this change feels like a \u201cgotcha\u201d until you rebuild your muscle memory for the new behavior because we\u2019re still getting used to it (caught by it!) ourselves",
        "The biggest challenge in building good software is making hard tradeoffs, and this new behavior is the shadow side that we\u2019ve adopted in order to build a highly-requested product improvement: switching between board and list views.",
        "The nature of what has to happen \u201cunder the hood\u201d to make that possible means that sections in list views have to act very like columns in a board view - and the Tab+N behavior is a result of us moving toward that world. For one example, ending a task in a board column with a colon doesn\u2019t split off a new column which contains the tasks below the task with a colon. If you think about it, however, this is what has been happening in a list view\u2013the new section suddenly takes ownership of all the tasks below it. This is why Tab+N creates a new (empty) section at the end of the current section - this is akin to what happens when creating a new empty column in a board view.",
        "So despite the fact that this group already has opinions on Tab+N (and therefore this poll isn\u2019t very scientifically rigorous), I\u2019d be interested to ask the group for opinions on which future state of Asana is better:",
        "To be further clear, I doubt that the results of this poll will change our course in moving to switching between project layouts (we have a lot of data and feedback that this is highly desired by our customers and from an engineering standpoint there are a lot of benefits from it) but hopefully it provides some insight into why we made this change.",
        "Well, in theory, \u201cappending colon\u201d could have been kept as a UI gesture and have it effectively do what TAB-N does but also rename the section to what was previously entered as the Task name? Can we assume you guys considered that but decided it was too expensive?",
        "Hard to see outside of myself on this (admittedly, I\u2019ve only ever used Asana in the List view BECAUSE of the lightweight manipulation of text lists into organized, actionable projects) but\u2026  this seems less about overcoming \u2018muscle memory\u2019 and more about newly introduced friction in what I found to be core to Asana\u2019s value.",
        "A trailing colon no longer makes a task into a section header. This is problematic because:",
        "The new hotkey is useful, but is not a proper replacement for the removed functionality. I\u2019d kindly like to suggest the trailing colon be reinstated, or some other wildcard be added to take its place.\n(Copy/paste with some markup system would be very useful for other things, like dates, assignees, etc.)",
        "Oh for the love of Pete, just bring back the colons already. Just have both. The new way holds you up when you\u2019re trying to add in a lot of information and interrupts flow.",
        "This post does a good job of explaining the need for the change. I\u2019m not really sure why there are still objections, particularly in light of how many people have begged for the ability to switch between lists and boards.",
        "I agree with @LeavingA, and as I\u2019ve pointed out, there are other problems from the partial rollout that I\u2019m waiting to hear about.",
        "I imagine most of us want the best of both worlds. I understand the issues of high backend costs of what supporting the \u201c:\u201d behavior would mean in the new model, but:",
        "I\u2019ve used other apps for years that have accomplished this (e. g., outliner tools that let you indent/outdent a task and manage containership still), and",
        "often there won\u2019t be too many tasks to update for this, e. g., when pasting a new list of tasks/sections or subtasks/subtask section, or when removing a \u201c:\u201d from a task with only a few tasks underneath. Is it completely out of the question to allow this when possible and either warn of delay or deny the operation outright with a toast explaining it\u2019s too costly and to use delete task and then Tab-N in this case?",

        "Your time is valuable. You know how much it\u2019s worth.",
        "I once saw a consultant who earns over $100/hour spend an hour arguing over a $5 overcharge. I completely understand the principle behind it, but is it really worth the $5 when you could actively bill another hour instead? Personally, I\u2019d chalk that up as a $95 loss.",
        "I learned to value my time when I decided to change my life by eating healthier and working out. Like many people, I was under the impression that I just didn\u2019t have enough time. Then I learned the truth:",
        "You don\u2019t have a time problem. You have a priority problem.",
        "I learned this when I met someone who worked multiple jobs, went to night school, and still found time to prepare meals and workout. We were talking about fitness and they randomly asked me a question about an episode of a television series I was watching. I responded, they nodded, and then hit me with this:",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. I thought you just said you don\u2019t have time to work out. Isn\u2019t that show an hour long?\u201d",
        "It turns out I had a lot of things chipping away at my time. I watched movies. I watched television. I played games. I interacted on social media. And I wasn\u2019t taking care of me.",
        "To change, I didn\u2019t have to give it all up. Instead, I had to change my priorities. I stopped watching full movies every night and made them a reward at the end of the week. I only allowed television after my workouts were complete. Prioritizing time isn\u2019t just important for fitness, but your career as well.",
        "How much drama do you allow in your life? I used to get sucked into online arguments. I had to get in the last word and respond to every reply. A business coach of mine pointed out just how much time I was wasting. He had an expression he liked to share, \u201cYou be right. I\u2019ll be rich.\u201d What he meant was that he didn\u2019t have time to argue the right side when he could use that time to build and grow his business.",
        "Have you ever taken stock of how much time you spend on threads that have nothing to do with advancing your career? Are you reading books that are fun to read, or that also help you learn something new you can use at work? When you commute into the office do you listen to the radio or a podcast? If you ride the bus or a train, do you spend the time liking Instagram posts or reading technical articles?",
        "You may be surprised how much time you gain back if you decide to focus on how much signal is in each hour versus how much noise you let in. Small tweaks can go a long way.",
        "Some specific email-related tips that helped my productivity explode:",
        "If you are curious how I maximize my personal productivity, take a few minutes to read this:",
        "medium.com",
        "I\u2019ve spent most of my life online. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I was using Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) in the 1980s to collaborate with people around the world. In the 1990s it was Internet Relay Chat (IRC) (where I also happened to meet my wife), followed by Friendster, MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. I get online community.",
        "It\u2019s no substitute for face-to-face interactions.",
        "I get what it\u2019s like to be an introvert. I know because many years ago, I was convinced that I was just born socially awkward and would never \u201cfit in.\u201d I loathed big crowds and when I sat in a waiting room, I\u2019d stick my nose in a book or other device to avoid interactions. My biggest fear when being introduced to someone was \u201cWhat do I say next?\u201d",
        "My first steps to transform weren\u2019t related to technology or my job, but my health. I was obese and struggled with various diets and programs. Eventually, I found a system I felt good about but still had serious doubts it would help me. The program featured \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos with success stories that were inspirational, but I still had my doubts. A work event brought me to the Miami area, and I knew that a man named Jeff who transformed his lifestyle was running a gym there. I stepped out of my comfort zone and scheduled and appointment. Meeting him was the catalyst I needed to believe in what was possible and transform. The books and websites and online pictures just weren\u2019t enough: I had to connect in person.",
        "I hit my goal.",
        "The changes inspired me to start my own fitness business, and I was forced to transform again when I left the technology industry to focus on personal training full time. Suddenly I had to sell my own services, provide customer support and coach clients. This helped me break further out of my comfort zone and gain a little more confidence interacting with people. After I sold my fitness business and got back into technology, I purposefully focused on fostering \u201cin person\u201d relationships.",
        "It\u2019s not as hard as it may seem. It can be as simple as attending a local user group meeting, traveling to a conference or attending a technology-related event. Having that experience can pay major dividends and create synergy because your return on investment is greater than the energy you put into it.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m an introvert\u201d may be true (and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that), but \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable around people\u201d is one of those thoughts you just may be able to change.",
        "For example, I was contacted online to be the technical editor for a book. I was on the project for several months when the publisher came to town for a conference and invited me to meet over coffee. We connected in person, and that led to an invitation to write my first book. That led to several other books and a lasting relationship.",
        "At my very first conference I met several individuals in the speaker room whom I only see on the road. Although we only meet once or twice a year, we\u2019ve developed friendships that spanned decades. Some of those speakers later went on to organize their own conferences and reached out for support. That led to further opportunities.",
        "Our team at Microsoft is globally distributed and mostly remote. We all work well together and leverage the latest technology to meet with video and screen sharing. Over time, however, it\u2019s been conferences that have forged the culture and fostered deeper relationships because we have the opportunity to interact face to face. Some of my most productive collaborations have been the direct result of spending time in person with a coworker in the speaker lounge or at the hotel restaurant.",
        "Any time you can take a little extra effort to connect in person will add value to your career, whether it\u2019s for opportunities, references, or just a friend to support you in times of need. This doesn\u2019t mean online interactions don\u2019t count, but it is too easy with modern technology to avoid old fashioned human-to-human interaction. Remember previous tips as well: this is still about being genuinely you, even if you are introverted, it\u2019s not about forcing yourself to be an extrovert but building trust and taking some risks.",
        "If it feels like politics, don\u2019t do it! It should be about relationships.",
        "I use Meetup.com to connect with local developers, and then follow up on LinkedIn.com to maintain business relationships over time.",
        "By my best estimate I\u2019ve conducted more than 100 interviews over my career and looked at thousands of resumes. I\u2019ve also revised mine over the past 25 years and sat in the interviewee chair many times. Unfortunately, the resume is often the first touch point and filter in the process and a poorly done resume may prevent a perfectly qualified candidate from getting a foot in the door. There are tons of sites that promise to improve your resume, so instead of making this a comprehensive \u201chow to\u201d guide I want to share a few highlights that I believe can make or break a curriculum vitae.",
        "First, what is your mission? It\u2019s tough for me to understand this:",
        "Extremely qualified and experienced professional with amazing skills that has received dozens of industry awards.",
        "OK, that\u2019s great \u2026 but why are you submitting your resume to me? Selfishly, I want to know if you are simply looking to check another box on a long list of projects, want to get exposed to new technology or singled out our company and really want to join. I urge you to think about what you really want and declare it on your resume. Not, \u201cThis is who I am\u201d but rather, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d",
        "Seeking an exciting position in developer relations that will use my extensive experience and skills to drive value by forging deep relationships in the developer community.",
        "For illustration, here\u2019s another example:",
        "Straight \u201cA\u201d student with three Azure certifications.",
        "How about \u2026",
        "Passionate developer seeking to partner with a company willing to tap into my enthusiasm and ability to learn new technologies to drive successful cloud adoption.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about the words I use so much, that\u2019s my style, but try to go from \u201cThis is who I am\u201d to \u201cThis is what I\u2019m seeking and willing to do.\u201d It will make your resume stand out!",
        "Always put your strengths at the top of the resume. If you are newer to the industry and education is your strong point, go with that. In my case, without a college degree, my experience and accolades go on top and a note about my education is at the bottom. Think about someone thumbing through one hundred resumes in one sitting and what you want to jump out at them from the page.",
        "Tie your skills into your experience. There is nothing more frustrating than reading that someone has extensive Web API experience, then finding no mention of it in their job history. When XML and XSLT were important skills (now I\u2019m dating myself again), I didn\u2019t just list \u201c3 years\u2019 experience with XML\u201d \u2026 I also demonstrated how I used it:",
        "Try to tie your skills into your experience. Speaking of experience, when you are listing history, please list what you did, not what you were supposed to do. Put yourself in a hiring manager\u2019s shoes. You see one resume that looks like this:",

        "Then another that looks like this:",
        "As a Senior Developer, successfully established coding standards to accelerate delivery and improve quality. Mentored several junior developers, one who was later promoted to senior. Led the team with successfully transitioning from WCF to REST.",
        "Finally, don\u2019t feel like it must be just about your mainline job duties and accomplishments. I include publications, videos, presentations and projects I worked on. The interview team has a very well-rounded view of my experience, passion, and abilities.",
        "Learning to say, \u201cno\u201d may just be the most powerful tool you can add to your arsenal.",
        "The first time I discovered this skill was at my first technology job. I originally was paid hourly. Night shift \u201cbonuses\u201d and overtime all added up to a hefty income for me at the time. That was when the boss called me in to inform me that I was being awarded for my professionalism by being \u201cpromoted\u201d to a salaried position. I was assured that my new salary was so significant it required special approval from the company\u2019s president. Unskilled in the art of negotiation, I smiled and said, \u201cYes!\u201d and left feeling let down. The salary they offered me was about 30% less than I was earning with hourly wages.",
        "After reflection, I turned the \u201cyes\u201d into a \u201cno\u201d and began seeking employment elsewhere. I am grateful to the company for giving me my first programming opportunity, but it was no longer the right fit. I ended up accepting a job in Atlanta and moved shortly thereafter. In Atlanta, it quickly became clear the new role wasn\u2019t a good fit either. Again, I said, \u201cno\u201d and moved onto another role that was crucial for the overall success of my career.",
        "Part of saying, \u201cno\u201d is understanding your priorities and living by them. My family is near the top of my priority list (ahead of job), so I try not to let my work interfere with family. Sometimes that means a firm, \u201cno\u201d when I\u2019m asked to go on trips or take on projects that will cut into that valuable time. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not a team player; on the contrary I\u2019m always willing to jump in and help in emergencies, but I have no patience for a culture that thrives on emergencies.",
        "I learned early on to value time and focus on maximum return on investment. That means I look for opportunities that reward productivity over activity. I\u2019m far more impressed with someone who has learned to be ultra-efficient and get things done in a sane work week than someone who is always burning the midnight oil and missing out on sleep to get things done. That\u2019s my personal preference and I\u2019ve learned to make it a firm \u201cno\u201d to firms that are more concerned with hours than output.",
        "Ask any of my colleagues at Microsoft. I\u2019m not afraid to say \u201cno\u201d when appropriate.",
        "Have you heard that love makes the world go \u2018round? That may be true, but money pays for the trip. There is nothing more annoying than someone who has tons of money proudly declaring that \u201cmoney isn\u2019t important.\u201d It\u2019s a core part of modern society, but people often forget\u2026",
        "Money isn\u2019t the thing. It\u2019s the thing that gets you the thing.",
        "It\u2019s important to understand what the thing is.",
        "Before I started my technology career, I toyed with the idea of becoming a professional pool player. I was in between jobs and couldn\u2019t afford table time, so I got a job at a pool hall. I made $20 a day working an 8-hour shift. $10 went to gas in my car, I saved $5 for rent and $5 for food (I typically walked over to a 7\u201311 and bought a pressed Cuban sandwich and chips). I lived that way for a year. And guess what? My job gave me free use of the pool hall, so after my shift ended at 4:30 pm in the afternoon I\u2019d often stay until midnight doing what I loved: playing rack after rack of one pocket and 9-ball. It turns out I didn\u2019t need to be rich to play unlimited pool.",
        "I\u2019ve always wanted to travel the world. In one of my early roles I built the software that integrates mainframes with warehouse conveyor belts to route and sort inventory. Many of our customers were international, so I was able to visit the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. At the time I would have had to save for quite a while to afford those trips on my own, but the job paid for the trip. The thing was the travel, so I didn\u2019t need to be \u201crich\u201d to get the thing.",
        "Understanding this is important because sometimes you must go backwards to move forwards. This is a plot of my salary over my career.",
        "Notice the first huge dip. That\u2019s when I took a major risk and started my own business. That career exposed me to the power of coaching and mentoring and helped me become confident speaking in public. I learned major lessons about what it takes to build and scale a company. You can see the first year I had no idea what I was doing but by the third year was earning more than I made in my previous technology role.",
        "The second dip happened when a successful entrepreneur reached out to me to ask if I\u2019d help him build a new software company. My income steadily improved over time, but my quality of life suffered. I was working startup hours five years in and my health was suffering as a result. There is a small dip I didn\u2019t circle that represents a lifestyle change. The company later sold for $1.5 billion, but I got to work from home as a consultant and spend more time with my family than I had in years. That was the thing.",
        "The last dip in salary happened as a sacrifice I made for the opportunity to step into my current role in developer relations. My personal mission statement is to empower developers to be their best, and that is the essence of this role and is reflected in the overall mission of our company. The dip was worth it to get paid to do what I love full time, and as a bonus I was promoted within a year anyway.",
        "The first several years I focused on the money and the money came grudgingly. The last several years I focused on what I wanted to do and how I wanted to balance my life, and the money seemed to click into place. Your mileage may vary but please remember it\u2019s not only about the Benjamins. Figure out the thing and focus on it.",
        "That\u2019s it! We\u2019ve made it through the ten top tips I believe helped shape my career. I hope they have a positive impact on yours. Did something stand out in particular?

You've got tons of whiteboard meetings, random discussions by the water cooler, random slack threads, ideas you think up in the middle of the night, different asks and different reqs coming in from different teams.  It's useful to formally write it all down.  And then once you see it all in one place, you can more easily see which parts of conversations you forgot, which decisions that you thought you all agreed on in the meeting but people actually thought you agreed on a different outcome.  You can see if there are any contradictory points -- does one decision you agreed on in one discussion actually make it impossible to follow the decision you agreed on in another discussion.  You've now got the big picture and see things now you're all zoomed out, that you couldn't see when each discussion was just drilled down into a single component or aspect.2) Coordinate for review.  So now it's all written down, and everyone can go through and see if there's anything that they missed.  Are there actually any blockers in here? You can now send it out to all the concerned parties and they can make sure that you didn't miss anything, that all concerns and asks are being properly covered.  Are all the original requirement actually being handled by this design?  How long is this actually going to take now for all the involved teams and people to do.  Much easier to do when you've got a complete list of everything you need to do.3) Documents your original intent.  So now you're off and implementing it all, and of course you end up building something completely different from the design doc.  But it's still important to go back to it and be able to see, what were all of these original concerns and blockers and worries that we had?  The design doc says we made this decision because of this showstopper, we ended up doing it a different way, but did we properly account for that in our final implementation.  Why did we even want to design it this way in the first place, does that constraint still hold today, and will our end result fail because we ignored it.",

        "Fullstack engineer who tries their best at design.Example: this website.",
        "Late last year I decided to start interviewing for new jobs. It had been over two years since I had last interviewed, and although I had been working and performing interviews for my employers this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly translate into keeping up your interview skills(although it does help). So in order to prepare for and perform well during my interviews I did a few things before my interviews which I will outline in this post and hopefully help some other engineers through their interview process. I definitely don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I am a technical interview master like some of the people you see on youtube and on blog posts, but these methods definitely helped me to perform better and feel less anxious before, during, and after interviews.",
        "First I just wanted to briefly touch on some of the things I did to find potential employers I was interested in, since I believe that a lot of engineers(and other professionals) may want to start looking for a new job but have no idea where to apply. I believe it is important to always keep up with other companies and be looking for companies you are interested in even if you are happy at your current job. I did not apply to any companies for over two years, but I made sure to keep up with what was happening in my industry. This allowed me to keep a running list of companies and industries in my head that I would be interested in working for when the time came to look. I believe an important part of job searching is finding companies that interest you, so that if you get the offer it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an easy decision to accept. I try my best to stay up to date in the tech world by reading blog articles and tech news articles, and I believe this among other things helped set me up for a quick and focused job search that led me to a job I was happy and excited for.",
        "However, even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a running list of companies and industries you find interesting, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to spend some time at the beginning of your job search to define what you value in your next role. What size company do you want to work for, what type of work or product is interesting to you, is there upward mobility, what industry or industries are you interested in, what would you like to get out of your next job, and what type of team would you like to work with are some questions you could ask yourself. By answering some questions about what you are looking for in your next job you can simplify your search and find companies that fulfill all or as many of your answers as possible.",
        "Equipped with a list of companies and specific industries, I was able to quickly apply and start the process with companies I knew I would want to work for. Because of this I was able to apply directly to companies and reach out to recruiters which I believe can help speed up the process. Also if you use hiring marketplaces like Hired and Vettery, you can set your job search characteristics and get more companies you are interested in to reach out to you. A lot of times people apply to any jobs they see and this can lead to you starting the interview process with a lot of companies at the same time, many of which you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to work for. Interviewing is an incredibly time consuming task, so I believe it is important to make sure you have a focused search that allows you to spend your time wisely and prepare well for interviews you want to do well in. By being better prepared for applying, I was able to keep my initial company search list short and move quickly through the interview process with a few companies I thought I would be happy to work for and therefore accept the jobs right away.",
        "Something to note is that if you have a friend or acquaintance at a company you want to work for I highly recommend getting a referral because this can help speed up the time to initial phone screening and getting your resume seen. Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know someone at a company sometimes people are willing to help out potential candidates so feel free to reach out to someone at a company you like on LinkedIn and see if they are willing to tell you about the company and potentially refer you.",
        "Although I do believe there are things you should do before, during, and after interviews to maximize your performance, prepping is most likely the most important because if you prep correctly then you will perform to your best ability during the interview. And if you perform to the best of your ability that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you can ask for out of an interview. Here are some of the things I did to prepare for interviews.",
        "For anyone who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about Cracking the Coding Interview it is basically a holy book when it comes to Software Engineering/Coding interviews. I originally read it back in college during my initial job search but it had been a while since I looked through it. It basically lays out a bunch of the fundamentals of performing well in technical interviews as well as has a bunch of practice questions across technical categories. I highly recommend owning a copy of this book even if you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actively looking for a job because I believe every software engineer should go through it at least once. It can also help you on the other side of the interview table to better ask questions and get ideas for questions. I recommend looking through the chapters and finding the most relevant ones for you or ones you need to improve the most in, since you may not need every type of question for certain positions. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give too much away because I think this is an important book that should be read on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, but there are a couple of chapters that talk about what to do before the interview and behavioral questions that I will focus on for this post. I recommend reading these especially since these will help you prepare and perform well in nontechnical interviews, which will help you get to the technical interview. Also if you make it to the on site you are more than likely going to have a round of behavioral questions as well.",
        "I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to not only prep for technical questions but also make sure you have answers to some basic behavioral questions. Before I had any HR screening calls, I made an interview prep document where first I outlined a simple answer to the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell me about yourself\u00e2\u0080\u009d question. In this outline I followed a simple approach. Start off by saying your current role and company, including a brief description of what that company does(just a few words). Next I moved to a brief(1-2 sentences) description of what originally got me into software engineering and what I studied in college. This may not be necessary for everyone and I did not always say this part, but since I am still fairly early on in my career I felt it was relevant to include. After that I would talk about my past roles and what I did at those companies, spending more time on my current role. Lastly if I felt it was needed, I would talk a little bit about my interests outside of work and how I became interested in or found the company I was talking too.",
        "Next based on the behavioral question chapter in Cracking the Coding Interview, I setup a matrix with a few potential behavioral topics for three different projects I worked on. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to completely give this away since the book outlines this, but I will go over the concept. There are a few different types of behavioral questions you may encounter that are based on past experiences and how you handled them. If you can outline answers to these topics of questions across multiple different projects you can then use this as a study guide before behavioral interviews. I would recommend making sure these examples are as concrete as possible and clear. If you have any friends who work as software engineers or recruiters, try bouncing these answers off of them and seeing if they think they are clear. You want to make sure you are completely answering the question with specific examples. A good sign you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely answered the question is if the interviewer continues to probe you on the question or asks you for another example. You should use other interviews to tweak or change your answers if need be.",
        "Lastly I would also recommend laying out answers to any questions you think they may ask you. Some questions are \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy are you leaving your current job?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat are you looking to get out of your next job?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Another especially important question you could have answers for is what are some of your weaknesses. All too often people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have strong answers to this question and it shows they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thought deeply about what they could do to improve themselves. I believe it is important for someone to always be looking for ways to get better, and having the self-awareness to know where you could improve is important for this. Try to create answers to as many possible questions so that you are better prepared. Put on your interviewer hat and think about what questions you might ask a potential candidate. Also I would come up with a list of possible questions to ask your interviewer. Interviewers will always leave time for you to ask questions, and you should use this time to the best of your ability. Come up with smart and thoughtful questions that give you more insight into the company and whether or not you would be happy there. Make sure the company matches what you are looking for in your next role.",
        "",
        "During my prep I came up with a simple 7 step approach to solving all technical questions. This may not work completely for every person, but I think it is important for you to come up with your own game plan for solving technical questions. This way when you get stuck or feel uncertain, just stick to the game plan to keep moving forward and unblock yourself. Make sure your game plan has methods to unblock yourself. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to always keep moving during technical interviews because you only have so much time. In some interviews if you can clearly show your ability to programmatically work through a problem, even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finish it, you can still pass. Feel free to use mine or adapt it. I will go over these 7 steps in my next post about Tips for Software Engineering Interviews.",
        "",
        "Do your research on the company, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interview process, and technical interview processes in general. Make sure you understand what the company does, what products they have launched recently, the role in general, any blog posts they have posted(or if they even have a blog), etc. It is important that you are able to clearly outline reasons why you want to work for the company and that you have done your research because this shows interest to your potential future employer. They want people excited and engaged in their company.",
        "It is also important to do your research on the interview process at each company you interview with. Make sure to look at glassdoor interview reviews and see what other people are saying. Although you should take glassdoor reviews with a grain of salt because it generally is where applicants who had bad experiences will go to, it is important to still recognize that these candidates had those experiences and there may be some problems at the company. However if this is a concern this is something you can bring up with during the HR portions of the process and see how they are addressing these concerns. I think the more reliable part of glassdoor is to look at past questions that candidates have been asked and make sure you practice these questions. Some companies will continue to ask the same questions for a little while, and you may also see a question on one company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile that another company will ask you (this happened to me). However glassdoor isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only place to find interview questions anymore, so do some googling on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interview process and see if you can find other resources as well.",
        "Lastly I think an incredibly important part of prep is to do research on interview processes in general and different types of questions. I watched loads of youtube videos about interview processes, questions, and methodologies for solving questions. As well as read dozens of blog posts on performing well in interviews. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world there are more and more resources popping up every day in multiple different mediums(video, written, spoken) for one topic or another including technical interviews(meta: including this post). Use these to your benefit and make sure you see what other people are saying about the process you are currently in. This led me to my 7 step algorithm, and definitely made me a better and more informed interviewer.",
        "",
        "I think this should be pretty self explanatory that the best way to get better at technical interviews is to practice as many technical questions as possible. However, it is important that you practice in real life situations. Act like each practice question is being asked to you by a real person and you have a set time to solve it. Use your game plan you came up with to solve each practice question. If you practice like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the real thing you will perform better when the interview comes. This is the same for any practice and reminds me of a quote by Vince Lombardi that \u00e2\u0080\u009cPractice doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Make sure you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just going through the motions when practicing, but make sure you are actually trying to solve the question to the best of your ability. It can also help you to perform better when practicing. When I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow my game plan for solving practice questions I would perform worse and have a harder time coming to a solution then when I followed the game plan like it was the real thing. Lastly just to touch on some resources for finding interview questions, you can use Cracking the Coding Interview, Leetcode (I recommend only easy and medium questions because you will rarely ever get a hard level question in an interview), and youtube videos. These were the three main sources that I used, but there are definitely more out there you could use.",
        "There was also a video(s) on youtube which outlined 10 important coding topics to understand and you could use to answer almost any technical coding interview question. And I say almost because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe you necessarily need to use one or more of these topics for every type of interview question, but they can help with most. You can find the videos that discuss these topics here and here.",
        "Before this round of interviewing, I had never gone through a system design interview either as an interviewer or interviewee. The last time I had interviewed I had been in college and most companies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require new grads to go through system design interviews since they generally lack this real world experience. So this was a new type of interview for me and something I spent pretty much all of my time working on once I had gone through a couple of technical phone screens and moved to onsites. I will say I think the best preparation for system design interviews is actually building real world systems. Therefore make sure in your current role you take every opportunity to build new systems. However, realistically this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something that everyone can always do in their current role. Nevertheless, spend as much time as you can understanding your companies current systems such as how they work, where they are limited, what are some incremental improvements that could be made, ask questions to senior engineers and tech leads about the systems, etc. Another thing you can do is to read blogs and tech posts about other companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 systems and what they are doing. Look at industry leaders and see how they are building systems, why, and what for, because more likely than not they are going to be doing it correctly.",
        "Nevertheless, these passive learning experiences don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely prepare you for what to expect in a system design interview. Another big problem is that different companies have to build different systems based on their needs and you probably aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be exposed to every type of system at your day job. You can constantly learn about real world systems and build great ones, but still fail a system design interview if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepare correctly and know what to expect. In order to prepare for the system design interview I personally did a few things. First I read through the chapter in Cracking the Coding Interview about system design interviews and attempted the practice problems outlined there as well as went through their solutions. The other main thing I did was google common system design interviews and watch youtube videos where they went through common system design questions. These were incredibly helpful to quickly see a bunch of new and different systems you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normally be exposed to at one single company. The biggest take away I got from all my preparation is that you need to be comfortable coming up with multiple possible solutions to a part of a system and discuss the trade offs. Know the differences and know how different things scale. A lot of people will also never build systems that need to scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of concurrent users, and sometimes these are questions that can come up in a system design interview.",
        "I hope that someone comes along and finds this interesting. I get incredibly anxious and stressed when it comes to technical interviews, which is a weird thing for me because I almost never felt that way in school. So before I started this interview process I tried my best to remove as much stress and anxiety as possible. I will say my first technical interview gave me a lot of anxiety but after I did one I felt less anxious because I could see my game plan work in action. By sticking to my gameplan, I was able to get to onsites with every company I interviewed with. Look for my follow up post on Technical Software Interview Tips where I go into detail on my game plan I used for coding challenges."

        "A few years ago, I watched an Olympic gymnast deliver a speech, \u201cHow to Score a Perfect Ten.\u201d He gave his talk while doing his pommel horse routine! He vaulted onto the horse, did a series of moves, then said, \u201cI get 9.4 points for getting on the horse and executing the required skills.\u201d Then, he launched into a fearless series of spins, suspended himself for a moment, and continued, \u201cI get another three-tenths of a point for embracing creativity and risk.\u201d For his last maneuver, he pressed himself into a full fingertip handstand, stretched his toes to the ceiling, then concluded, \u201cI get those last three-tenths of a point through extension.\u201d",
        "I thought this was a fantastic metaphor for performing the Product Leader role at a world-class level. Below, I:",
        "As the SVP of The Learning Company/Mattel, the VP of Product Management at Netflix, and the Chief Product Officer at Chegg (a homework help/textbook rental company), I have hired, managed, and developed hundreds of product leaders. The job is hard, but I describe the role straightforwardly:",
        "Your job is to delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways.",
        "As I evaluate candidates, I focus on two separate sets of skills: the technical skills required of all product managers and the functional leadership skills needed to grow into VP-level roles.",
        "The technical skills of a product manager",
        "When I interview a product leader, I ask them to force-rank their capabilities against each of these skills:",
        "In interviews, I ask for examples of how a product leader demonstrates their top two skills. I also work to ensure they have all the baseline skills required, especially in consumer science skills.",
        "The second list, below, outlines the functional leadership skills \u2014 those skills required to develop into a VP Product role. Again, I ask candidates to force rank the skills.",
        "Functional leadership skills",
        "As before, I ask candidates to give examples to verify their top two skills. One important note: With \u201cculture,\u201d there are two questions embedded in the attribute:",
        "If the two lists of skills above look daunting, there\u2019s good news: you don\u2019t have to learn all of the skills overnight. They develop over time.",
        "The Career of a Builder",
        "Most product managers love building stuff. I\u2019ll ask a candidate what they did over the weekend, and they\u2019ll answer, \u201cI hosted a dinner party for twelve,\u201d or \u201cI used my short-wave radio to talk to someone in Vietnam.\u201d These are good examples of creative pursuits from people who love to build stuff.",
        "There\u2019s a natural progression in a product leader\u2019s career, starting with \u201cbuild something\u201d and culminating with \u201cbuild an industry.\u201d Below, I outline the steps, along with the skills needed at each stage:",
        "Looking at the list above, think about your current career stage and work examples you\u2019d give to demonstrate your capabilities at that stage.",
        "Here are examples from my career:",
        "Another benefit of this \u201ccareer as builder\u201d model is identifying which skills you need to develop at each stage, especially if you find yourself stuck at one level. Look ahead to the next step in your career and identify the skills you need to develop to get to that stage.",
        "2. EMBRACING CREATIVITY & RISK: Hacking Your Career",
        "The previous list of skills and stages makes career advancement seem linear. It\u2019s not. As an example, LinkedIn analyzed the data for how employees advance to a CEO role. The conclusion: the fastest path to CEO is a winding one \u2014 from customer service to marketing to operations to finance \u2014 which allows folks to develop the skills needed to provide cross-functional leadership and manage folks in different functions.",
        "My career was a winding path. During a year off from college, I ran a sailing school, graduated as an English major, and then joined the mailroom at an ad agency. I eventually advanced to account services (think \u201cMad Men\u201d), left to join a design firm, then developed into a marketing leader. After graduating from business school, I joined Electronic Arts as a marketer, then switched to product. Over the next twenty years, I enjoyed alternating success and failure, helping to scale both education and entertainment startups as a product leader.",
        "Framing Your Career Hypotheses",
        "As product leaders, we execute lots of experiments to determine what\u2019s best. We form hypotheses, test them, then create new theories based on results.",
        "Looking back, I wish I had taken a more hypothesis-driven approach to navigate my career. Today, I describe these career hypotheses as \u201cforks in the road\u201d \u2014 a series of questions you need to answer over time. For me, these questions would have looked something like this. (I bolded my eventual choice.)",
        "Over the years, I did test these hypotheses via side projects, by talking with folks in roles that interested me and by occasionally diving into new positions. I joined Electronic Arts as a marketer, then moved into product a few years later, and I loved the role. And as much as I wanted to be a \u201cstarter,\u201d I concluded I was better at helping established startups scale. (I\u2019m a \u201cbuilder.\u201d) As for the entertainment v. education hypothesis, the answer is both \u2014 I bounce back and forth between the two industries.",
        "The Right Metric?",
        "If you embrace \u201ccareer hacking,\u201d which metrics should you measure to evaluate your career hypotheses? Below, I illustrate one potential answer: income. I have graphed my income over time, beginning with the J World Sailing School and ending with my current role as a teacher, speaker, and writer:",
        "The two periods with no income correspond to my two years at business school, then a two-year sabbatical after selling \u201cFamilyWonder\u201d to Sega of Japan. Note that I didn\u2019t get put in the \u201cpenalty box\u201d after the sabbatical; my income quickly resumed its growth. It\u2019s ok to take time off if you can afford it.",
        "Another potential metric: job satisfaction. In talking with folks about their careers, one of the first questions I ask is, \u201cOn a 0\u201310 scale, where zero sucks and ten is awesome, what\u2019s your current job satisfaction?\u201d Here\u2019s a graph of my satisfaction over time:",
        "My job satisfaction number bounces up and down and is often the inverse of income.",
        "Self-analysis: My experience at Netflix scored a nine for a long time, but then began to slide below seven. The reality was that as much as I was the right person to help the startup to scale, I didn\u2019t have the right skills to advance the company to the next level. At Chegg, I was delighted to help the company scale and go public but eventually felt bogged down by the slow rate of change in the education industry.",
        "Today, I have exceptionally high job satisfaction \u2014 teaching and speaking is a lot of fun, and I enjoy my very flexible schedule. My current job satisfaction matches my earliest career satisfaction when running a sailing school \u2014 I love to teach.",
        "Another potential metric: the extent to which your work is \u201cgood for the world.\u201d Below is my wife\u2019s evaluation of my work. (She has high standards and is focused on developing novel approaches to treating cancer \u2014 a worthy endeavor.)",
        "You can see the upward trend during my educational software years and the lower rating during my entertainment tenure (EA, Netflix). Note the high rating during my sabbatical; during those two years, I spent a lot of time with my two young daughters, tutored at their school, and engaged in other community projects. And today, I have the highest rating for \u201cgood for the world,\u201d embracing my role as a teacher and mentor.",
        "\u201cMake it an 8.\u201d",
        "So, what\u2019s the right metric? I find the most helpful metric is job satisfaction. If your satisfaction is an eight or above, things are good. If it\u2019s below an eight, I work to change the job or to develop skills that will make me a better fit for the role. But if six months go by, and my satisfaction is still below an 8, I start looking for my next opportunity, either within the same company or at a new one.",
        "There are a few things that help me to navigate the long and winding road of my career:",
        "The advice I would give to my \u201cyounger self?\u201d Be bold. I should have been more aggressive about pursuing my passions earlier. I wish I had experimented more quickly with new ideas via side projects and had been braver about taking on new opportunities when my job satisfaction fell.",
        "My last few years of \u201cCareer Hacking.\u201d",
        "Since 2015, I have done my best to follow my own advice. After Chegg went public, I concluded that I didn\u2019t want to take on another full-time product leader role as I had a strong \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d feeling about the position.",
        "I could afford to stop work, but I needed to fulfill my sense of purpose and social needs \u2014 two things that jobs satisfy. Last, I needed enough structure in my life that I would not \u201cbounce off the walls\u201d or drive my wife crazy.",
        "Below, I list my \u201ccareer\u201d hypotheses \u2014 my \u201cforks in the road\u201d over the last few years of my career. (I indicate my eventual choices in bold.)",
        "I spent lots of time talking to folks in roles on the list above. But mainly, I learned by doing. Here are a couple of experiments and insights over the last few years:",
        "In contrast to the early days of my career, I was more purposeful about exploring my \u201cforks in the road\u201d to discover what roles suited me best. Today, my job satisfaction bounces between 9 and 10 \u2014 hacking my way into a non-traditional career has been very rewarding.",
        "3. EXTENDING YOUR CAREER: Build your Board",
        "Career hacking requires a series of relatively quick decisions to determine the \u201cbest fit\u201d roles for you. You need to be self-aware about your skills and what fulfills you, plus you need to evaluate many different roles and industries. Given that no one possesses complete self-awareness, it\u2018s a bad idea to go it alone.",
        "I wasn\u2019t deliberate about forming a board of directors until after my two-year sabbatical when I had to fight my way back into the career world. At this point, I set up two conversations/day with past colleagues, role models that inspired me, entrepreneurs, VCs, recruiters, and people whose judgment I valued to figure out \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d In the end, there were 5\u201310 people I consistently kept in touch with to help identify my career path. You can think of these folks as my personal board of directors.",
        "Here are a few examples of how my board helped me over the years:",
        "I have maintained a personal board of directors for fifteen years. Here\u2019s what I have learned:",
        "My board of directors includes both peers and mentors. Here\u2019s what I have learned in recruiting both:",
        "Peers",
        "Mentors",
        "I seek the following attributes as I evaluate mentors on my board:",
        "Finding and developing mentor relationships",
        "The most common question I get about building a board is, \u201cHow do I connect with mentors?\u201d Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned:",
        "In the long-run, I don\u2019t find much difference in how you develop and maintain peer or mentor relationships \u2014 the lines begin to blur. In both cases, maintain these relationships with updates, notes on topics your board may be interested in, or an occasional invite for coffee or Zoom call.",
        "CONCLUSION: Get on the Pommel Horse & Take Action",
        "As an aspiring world-class product leader, here are your action items:",
        "I will leave you with one final thought \u2014 what I call the \u201c2 a.m.\u201d test:",
        "What ideas do you find yourself engaged in at two in the morning? Is there something you are so passionate about in your work life that you can\u2019t not do it?",
        "The answer can provide a career hypothesis to explore and begin to test tomorrow. How might you test this hypothesis via side projects, informational interviews, or by connecting with someone who works in this area? Be bold.",
        "I hope you found this essay helpful, and I\u2019d love it if you could give me feedback on this essay by clicking here. (The survey has three questions and only takes one minute.)",

    "66: How to write an effective developer resume: Advice from a hiring manager - Stack Overflow": [
        "Based on reviewing hundreds of resumes per year and researching a book, here are the seven pieces of advice for engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "In an ideal world, you wouldn\u2019t need a resume. You\u2019d have a recruiter reach out to you along the lines of: \u201cYour ex-colleague Bob spoke extremely highly of your time working at Stack Overflow. Our company is growing, and we\u2019d love to talk with you. Do you have time to chat with a few members of the team next Wednesday?\u201d",
        "However, in reality, you will, at some point, find yourself applying at a company where Bob is not there to vouch for you, so you cannot skip through the process of being evaluated before the team will talk to you.",
        "I\u2019ve been a hiring manager for numerous companies and typically go through hundreds of resumes per year. I\u2019ve also researched the topic of writing a developer resume that represents you well while writing the book The Tech Resume Inside Out: What a Good Developer Resume Looks Like. For the book, I ended up talking with two dozen recruiters and hiring managers at the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Transferwise, and other well-known companies.",
        "Based on that experience, here are the seven pieces of advice that I give to engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "Many engineers assume their resume should just contain highlights of their employment history. They\u2019ve seen other people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles and seen a few resumes. Most of these look like this, and companies must be interested in what you did. Right?",
        "Wrong.",
        "The goal of your resume is to sell you enough to get a recruiter phone call and continue the process. This is a very different goal from telling your entire professional story. Your goal should be to showcase to the company why you\u2019re a good fit for the position they are recruiting for.",
        "This means highlighting parts of your resume that show you being a great match for a specific position. Tuning it to fit the opening might be as simple as changing the order of things or adding specific details that only this position might find interesting. When you have lots of experience, this might mean cutting less relevant parts short and leaving irrelevant things off.",
        "Here\u2019s how a typical hiring manager and recruiter will read your resume:",
        "1. Quick scan. They\u2019ll do a short scan of a few seconds, gathering all key information. Your location, years of experience, languages and technologies, position names, company names, and anything else that stands out.",
        "2. Second read. Assuming this first scan matches what they\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll re-read your resume, top to bottom, reading the content you wrote. However, if, in the quick scan, it didn\u2019t seem that you have what the position needs, there will be no second read.",
        "You should choose a resume format that helps highlight the key information the recruiter or hiring manager looks for in that first scan. A good resume template follows these principles:",
        "Why bother spending the time finding a good template? The less effort it is for a recruiter to get the key information in the quick scan, the more time they\u2019ll have to look at other parts of your resume. Here\u2019s a resume template you could use\u2014I created this template for the book, and it satisfies all the above requirements. Of course, there are many others to choose from, and you can also design your own.",
        "The recruiter or hiring manager will read your resume top to bottom. You\u2019ll want the most relevant parts to be at the top and less relevant ones towards the bottom. When you have lots of experience, it\u2019s fine to go beyond just one page: just make sure that everything relevant is still on the first page.",
        "When you\u2019re a new grad or bootcamp grad, hiring managers usually care about experience in this order:",
        "When you have work experience, the way a recruiter reads your resume changes. Here is what will be most relevant:",
        "With lots of work experience, you start to stand out from the crowd of applicants. At the same time, you\u2019ll probably have more experience than would fit on a page or two. In this case, a one-page resume is no longer a must-have, but you\u2019ll want to be more concise in your earlier experience: especially when that experience is not as relevant. Here\u2019s the order you could consider structuring your resume:",
        "It can feel painful to cut away some of your experience from your resume. But keep in mind your goal: it\u2019s to have that recruiter call. I collaborated with a systems administrator turned developer who had 20 years of experience. Ten years ago, they went back to college to get a computer science degree. Their original resume had all 20 years of experience listed: non-CS degree, ten years working as a systems admin, CS degree, ten years as a developer. The first ten years did not add much professionally to their resume: they ended up removing this, but still keeping their first, non-CS degree there. The new resume was cleaner, and they saw more callbacks with it.",
        "While you don\u2019t need to remove old positions, you should aim to reduce detail mentions significantly, except if they would add something very valuable for your current job application.",
        "Keep regional and cultural differences in mind as you craft your resume. For example, in most of the US, a one-page resume is the norm for developers with less than a few years\u2019 experience. Even more senior people aim to fit everything important on the first page. In most of Europe, resumes of two pages are common, and some hiring managers actually prefer to read longer resumes for senior people. Whatever the length, make sure you communicate the relevant parts first. Use the space wisely, elaborating more on your experiences and results that relate to the position you are applying for.",
        "Positions hiring for generalist software engineers will want to see some evidence that you have worked with a few technologies. For these places, it\u2019s a good sign if you\u2019ve mastered multiple technologies. Positions hiring for specific technologies will want to confirm that you did meaningful work with those technologies.",
        "There are a few ways you could make it clear what languages and technologies you are proficient with:",
        "1. Have a separate section for \u201clanguages and technologies\u201d on the first page of your resume.",
        "In this section, list out areas you are proficient with. Don\u2019t bother specifying your expertise level: the hiring manager will assume you know these well enough if you listed them. An example of this approach can look like this:",
        "2. Call out languages and technologies that you used as part of your work experience.",
        "An alternative to the previous approach is to mention the tools you used in each position. This gives more context on when you used these technologies or frameworks and what problems you solved using them. You could just list these out separately at the end of each position like this:",
        "However, I recommend \u201cweaving in\u201d the languages and technologies to the description itself. This both reads better, and you can give even more context:",
        "One thing I wish more resumes had is specifics. The majority of CVs I\u2019ve read tend to list responsibilities, what work was assigned, or have a hand-wavy explanation of the work. Here\u2019s an example of a resume snippet that recruiters and hiring managers see all too commonly:",
        "While the person writing these details probably felt they were showcasing the work they were doing\u2014the hiring manager gets little to no context on the specifics of the work. To stand out, be specific. To be specific, follow this approach:",
        "Having a \u201cmaster\u201d resume and tailoring it for every position you apply for is a great strategy. The tailoring doesn\u2019t have to be drastic. However, if you are applying for a company where the job listing lists the stack as React and Node\u2014and you have experience with these, among other languages\u2014moving these up front could be a small change with a big impact. Similarly, if you\u2019ve done work similar to what the position is asking for, having these bullet points listed first are all good ways to grab the attention of the person reading the resume earlier.",
        "One last thing I need to call out, as developers seeking jobs bring it up: the application tracking systems (ATS), and robots \u201crejecting\u201d your resume. This is false. Your resume will be read by a human. At tech companies, ATSes do not \u201creject\u201d resumes, and \u201crobot rejection\u201d does not exist in tech. Be wary of any resource that claims this is true: they are probably using the tactic to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt as an incentive for you to buy their service. I\u2019m saying this both as a hiring manager who has worked with ATSes and as an author who interviewed recruiters at all major tech companies. I asked them about robot rejections; they all confirmed that they have not seen or heard of such a practice.",
        "Applying for a job does not end with having a good resume. A few things can greatly help your job search: referrals, cover letters, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.",
        "Employee referrals are the best way to increase your chances of hearing back from a company. If you have a strong referral, much of the above becomes less relevant. How do you get a referral? You ask. Ask around in your network to see who is hiring. Ask on public forums where tech professionals gather like Twitter or LinkedIn\u2014potentially even Blind. You can try and reach out for a cold referral: but if you do, add context on why you think you are a great fit for a job and offer an easy way out for the person to not refer you if they do not feel comfortable doing so.",
        "Cover letters are a coin toss. For larger companies, these places usually either don\u2019t ask for one, or don\u2019t pay much attention to it. At smaller firms and startups, where hiring managers are likely to read resumes and cover letters, it\u2019s a better investment to spend time on this. Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. Don\u2019t repeat your resume: add additional details that make your case stronger as to why you are a good fit for the position you are applying to.",
        "Even if you are not looking for a job today, invest in growing your professional network. The larger your network, the easier you can get referrals from people who know the professional \u201cyou.\" To grow your network, build genuine relationships with others, help people, and make yourself visible. You don\u2019t have to do this on social media: you can start right now at your workplace, within and outside your team.",
        "LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow are all sites where having an up-to-date profile will greatly help your job search. Keep your LinkedIn up to date: it\u2019s a good idea to refresh it as you write your resume. For GitHub, consider creating a GitHub README to present yourself and your key projects more effectively. Make sure projects you mention in your resume or those that you pin to your GitHub profile also have READMEs that share what the project is about. On Stack Overflow, tailor your Developer Story to make it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to find you with relevant opportunities.",

        "I\u2019ve noticed a lot of confusion in the industry about various software roles and titles, even among founders, hiring managers, and team builders. What are the various roles and responsibilities on a software team, and which job titles tend to cover which roles?",
        "Before I dig into this too much, I\u2019d like to emphasize that every team is unique, and responsibilities tend to float or be shared between different members of the team. Anybody at any time can delegate responsibilities to somebody else for various reasons.",
        "If your team isn\u2019t exactly what I describe here, welcome to the club. I suspect very few teams and particular software roles will match perfectly with what we\u2019re about to explore. This is just a general framework that describes averages more than any particular role or team.",
        "I\u2019ll start with management titles and work my way through various roles roughly by seniority.",
        "I\u2019d also like to emphasize that you should not feel constrained by your job title. I like to build an engineering culture which favors:",
        "I like to reward initiative with increased responsibility, and if somebody has the skills and initiative to take on and outgrow the title they\u2019re hired for, I like to promote rather than risk losing a rising star to another company or team.",
        "We\u2019ll also talk a little about how these roles relate to other roles including:",
        "Note: Sometimes \u201cdirector\u201d, or \u201chead\u201d titles indicate middle managers between tech managers and the C-Suite. Often, \u201cChief\u201d titles indicate a C-suite title. C-suite employees typically report directly to the CEO, and have potentially many reports in the organizations they lead. At very large companies, those alternate titles often fill similar roles to C-suite executives, but report to somebody who is effectively the CEO of a smaller business unit within the larger organization. Different business units sometimes operate as if they are separate companies, complete with their own isolated accounting, financial officers, etc. Different business units can also have VPs, e.g., \u201cVice President of Engineering, Merchant Operations\u201d.",
        "The title \u201cfellow\u201d is the pinnacle of achievement for software engineers. It is typically awarded in recognition of people who have made outstanding contributions to the field of computing, and is usually awarded after an engineer writes a number of top selling books, wins prizes like the Turing Award, the Nobel Prize, etc. In other words, fellows are usually already famous outside the organization, and the company is trying to strengthen their brand by more strongly associating themselves with admired and influential people.",
        "In my opinion, organizations should not try to hire for \u201cfellow\u201d roles. Instead, find the best and brightest, hire them, and then grant the title (and benefits) if the engineer is deserving of it.",
        "A fellow typically also holds another title at the company. Often a CTO, Architect, VP of Engineering, or principal role, where they are in a position to lead, mentor, or serve as an example and inspiration to other members of the organization.",
        "The CEO is the position of most authority in an organization. Typically, they set the vision and north star for the company. They rally everybody around a common understanding of why the company exists, what the mission is, and what the company\u2019s values are. Frequently, CEOs are also the public face of the company, and in some cases, become synonymous with the brand (e.g., Steve Jobs with Apple, Elon Musk with Tesla/SpaceX, etc.)",
        "In some cases, CEOs are also the technical founder of a software organization, in which case, they also often fill the CTO role, and may have a VPs of Operations, Sales, Strategy, and Marketing helping with some of the other common CEO responsibilities.",
        "The CEO of a small company frequently wears a lot of hats, as you may have picked up from all the other roles that fell out of the CEO title when I mentioned that some CEOs lead the technology team.",
        "In any case, if there are important organizational decisions to be made, you can\u2019t run it up the chain of responsibility any higher than the CEO.",
        "If you are a CEO, remember that you\u2019re ultimately responsible, and you should trust your instincts, but don\u2019t forget that even most famous CEOs have mentors and advisors they consult with on a regular basis. Trust your gut, but seek out smart, insightful people to challenge you to improve, as well.",
        "Like the CEO role, the CTO role shape-shifts over time. At young startups, the CTO is often a technical cofounder to a visionary or domain-driven CEO. Frequently they are not qualified to take the title at a larger company, and hopefully grow into it as the company grows. Frequently, a startup CTO finds that they prefer more technical engineering roles, and settle back into other roles, like Principal Engineer, VP of Engineering, or Chief Architect.",
        "In many organizations, the mature CTO role is outward facing. They participate in business development meetings, frequently helping to land large partnerships or sales. Many of them hit the conference circuit and spend a lot of time evangelizing the development activities of the organization to the wider world: sharing the company\u2019s innovations and discovering opportunities in the market which match up well with the company\u2019s core competencies. CTOs frequently work closely with the product team on product strategy, and often have an internal-facing counterpart in engineering, such as the VP of Engineering.",
        "CTOs also frequently set the vision and north star of the engineering team. The goals for the team to work towards.",
        "The Chief Innovation Officer (CIO) is like a CTO, but typically employed by a company that would not normally be considered a \u201ctech company\u201d. The goal of the CIO is to reshape the company into one that consumers perceive as tech-savvy and innovative: To show the world what the future of the industry looks like, no matter what that industry is. For example, a home remodeling superstore chain might have a CIO responsible for partnering with tech companies to build a mixed reality app to show shoppers what a specific couch or wall color would look like in their living room, or using blockchains and cryptocurrencies to enhance the security and efficiency of supply chain logistics.",
        "Not to be confused with a Chief Information Officer (CIO), a title which is typically used in companies who are even more detached from technology, interested about as far as it aids their core operations. Unlike a Chief Innovation Officer, A Chief Information Officer is more likely to be leading tech integration and data migration projects than building new apps and trying to figure out how a company can disrupt itself from the inside. There are Chief Information Officers who act more like Chief Innovation Officers, but in my opinion, they should use the appropriate title.",
        "Most tech-native companies (app developers, etc) don\u2019t have either kind of CIO. Instead, those responsibilities fall to the CTO and VP of Engineering.",
        "While CTOs often face outward, the VP of Engineering often faces inward. A VP of Engineering is frequently responsible for building the engineering team and establishing the engineering culture and operations. The CTO might tell the engineering team what needs to get done on the grand scale, e.g., \u201cbe the leading innovator in human/computer interaction\u201d. The VP of Engineering helps foster a culture that manages the \u201chow\u201d. The best VPs of Engineering at first come across as somebody who\u2019s there to help the team work efficiently, and then they almost disappear. Developers on the team collaborate well, mentor each other, communicate effectively, and they think, \u201cHey, we\u2019re a great team. We work really well together!\u201d and maybe they think that\u2019s all a lucky accident.",
        "The truth is that almost never happens by accident. It happens because there\u2019s a VP of Engineering constantly monitoring the team\u2019s progress, process, culture, and tone of communications. They\u2019re encouraging developers to use certain tools, hold specific kinds of meetings at specific times in order to foster better collaboration with fewer interruptions. The best VPs of Engineering have been engineers, both on dysfunctional teams, and on highly functional teams. They know the patterns and anti-patterns for effective software development workflows.",
        "They work with the heads of product and product managers to ensure that there\u2019s a good product discovery process (they don\u2019t lead it or take charge of it, just make sure that somebody is on it and doing it well), and that product and design deliverables are adequately reviewed by engineers prior to implementation hand offs. I\u2019m going to stop there before I write a book on all the work that goes into leading effective development operations. For more of my thoughts on this topic, check out How to Build a High Velocity Development Team.",
        "Many startups are too small to hire a full time VP of Engineering, but it\u2019s still very important to get engineering culture right as early as possible. If you need help with this, reach out.",
        "At small organizations, the chief architect could be a technical co-founder with the self-awareness to realize that they won\u2019t want the responsibilities of a CTO as the company grows. Maybe they don\u2019t like to travel, or are simply more interested in software design than conference talks, business development, and sales calls that infiltrate the lives of many CTOs. The chief architect may be responsible for selecting technology stacks, designing collaborations and interfaces between computing systems, assessing compute services offerings (AWS, Azure, ZEIT Now, etc.), and so on. A chief architect may evaluate a wide range of industry offerings and make pre-approved or favored recommendations to work with particular vendors.",
        "As the company matures, the chief architect may also need to work closely with the CTO, and sometimes partner organizations to develop integrations between services. At many companies, the CTO also serves as the chief architect.",
        "A software architect serves many of the purposes of a chief architect, but is generally responsible for smaller cross-sections of functionality. Architects will often work with the chief architect to implement their slice of the larger architectural vision. Software architects often make tech stack choices for particular applications or features, rather than company-wide decisions.",
        "An Engineering Project Manager (also called \u201cEngineering Manager\u201d or simply \u201cProject Manager\u201d) is in charge of managing the workflow of an engineering team. Some larger companies have both Engineering Managers and Project Managers. In that case, the Engineering Manager typically acts like the VP of Engineering at the local team scope, while the Project Manager takes on the responsibilities described here.",
        "Project Managers typically interface with both product leaders and an engineering leader such as VP of Engineering, CTO, or a middle manager to cultivate and prune the work backlogs, track the progress of work tickets, detailed progress reports (milestone burn down charts, completed vs open tickets, month/month progress reports, etc.) You can think of them as the analog of a shop manager for a manufacturing assembly line. They watch the work floor and make sure that the assembly line runs smoothly, and work product isn\u2019t piling up on the floor in front of a bottleneck.",
        "The best Project Managers also spend a lot of time classifying issues and bugs in order to analyze metrics like bug density per feature point, what caused the most bugs (design error, spec error, logic error, syntax error, type error, etc.) and so on. Those kinds of metrics can be used to measure the effectiveness of various initiatives, and point out where improvements can be made to the engineering process.",
        "Engineering Managers tend to develop a good understanding of the strengths of various team members, and get good at assigning work tickets to the appropriate responsible parties, although, this should be a collaborative effort, seeking feedback from individual developers on what their career goals are and what they want to focus on, within the bounds of the project scope available.",
        "If there is time pressure or work backlogs piling up, the Project Manager should collaborate with the engineering and product leaders to figure out the root cause and correct the dysfunction as soon as possible.",
        "Wherever possible, the Project Managers should be the only ones directly delegating tasks to individual engineers in order to avoid the multiple bosses problem. Engineers should have a clear idea of who they report directly to, and who\u2019s in charge of delegating to them. If you\u2019re a different kind of engineering leader, and you\u2019re guilty of delegating directly to engineers, it\u2019s probably a good idea to coordinate with the Engineering Manager in charge of the report you\u2019re delegating to and delegate through them so that the work receives correct, coordinated prioritization, and the Engineering Manager is aware of what each engineer is actively working on at any given moment.",
        "At very small organizations, the Engineering Manager is often also the CTO and VP of Engineering (with or without the corresponding titles). If that\u2019s you, don\u2019t worry about the previous paragraph.",
        "A common dysfunction is that the Engineering Manager can begin to think that because product hands off work for engineering to implement, and Engineering Managers work closely with product teams, that the Engineering Manager reports to a Product Manager. In every case I\u2019ve seen that happen, it was a mistake. See \u201cAvoiding Dysfunctions\u2026\u201d below.",
        "The Tech Lead or Team Lead is usually the leader of a small number of developers. They are usually senior engineers who act like mentors, examples, and guides for the rest of the team. Usually, engineers report to the project manager or engineering manager, but a tech lead may be responsible for the team\u2019s code quality measures, such as ensuring that adequate code reviews are being conducted, and that the team\u2019s technical standards (such as TDD) are being upheld.",
        "Generally, engineers can take one of two career paths: move into management, or keep coding. Management positions aren\u2019t for everyone. Lots of engineers prefer to stay on the technical path. That progression can take many directions, twists, and turns, but could look something like this:",
        "Intern -> Junior Software Developer -> Software Developer/Engineer -> Senior Software Engineer -> Principal Software Engineer -> Software Architect -> Senior Software Architect -> Chief Architect -> CTO -> Engineering Fellow",
        "Alternatively, for those engineers interested in a people leadership role, a progression might look something like this:",
        "Intern -> Junior Software Developer -> Software Developer/Engineer -> Team Lead/Tech Lead -> Engineering Manager/Project Manager -> Senior Engineering Manager -> Director of Engineering -> VP of Engineering",
        "IMO, VP of Engineering, CTO, VP of Product, and VP of Marketing should all report directly to the CEO. Each of them needs to be in charge of their own process. External facing CTOs should not have direct reports (if they do, it usually means they are filling both the CTO and VP of Engineering Roles). Instead, the Engineering leaders report to the VP of Engineering. This is to avoid the two bosses dysfunction, but also because these roles are fundamentally different: one focused on the customer and how the organization fits into the wider world, and the other focused on internal, day-to-day operations. They\u2019re two wildly different skill sets, with sometimes competing priorities.",
        "I\u2019ve seen a lot of dysfunction in engineering leadership because of confusion about which engineering leaders are responsible for what, and it tends to be a recipe for disaster. Whatever is right for your organization, make sure that responsibilities and chain of authority are clear, in order to avoid engineers feeling torn between two or three different \u201cbosses\u201d.",
        "Likewise, in an organization of sufficient size, product and engineering need to be two separately led teams. What I mean by that is that the product managers should own the product roadmap. They should be evangelists for the users, and they should be really plugged into the users, often engaging with them 1:1 and learning about their workflows and pain-points in great depth. They should be experts on what the market needs, and they should be very familiar with the company\u2019s strengths and capabilities to fill those needs.",
        "That said, the VP of Engineering (or whomever is filling that role) needs to be in charge of delivery, and production pace. While the product managers should own the roadmap, the engineering managers need to be responsible for taking those roadmap priorities, matching them to the engineering capacity, and reporting on the timing. Product and marketing teams will have strong opinions about when something should ship, but only the engineering management has a good gauge of whether or not those delivery timelines are possible given the roadmap requirements. The engineering team needs the authority not simply to push back on timing, but in most cases, to completely own timing, working with the CEO, product, and marketing teams to figure out priorities, understand strategic needs of the company, and then help shape a development cadence that can meet those needs without imposing drop-dead deadlines that ultimately hurt the company\u2019s ability to deliver quality products at a reliable pace.",
        "The best performing teams I\u2019ve ever been involved with subscribed to the no deadlines approach. We build great products without announcing them in advance, and then let the marketing teams promote work that is already done. Alternatively, when you\u2019re working in the public view, transparency is a great solution. Instead of cramming to meet an arbitrary deadline, actively share your progress, with ticket burn-down charts, a clear view of remaining work, progress, pace, and remaining scope, and change over time that can indicate scope creep. When you share detailed information about the progress being made, and share the philosophy that we can\u2019t promise a delivery date, but we can share everything we know about our progress with you, people can see for themselves the work and the pace.",
        "Because of differing, often competing goals, product, marketing and engineering need to be separate roles reporting directly to the CEO where none of them can dictate to each other. If your team feels time pressure to work overtime, or crunch to get some key deliverable out before some drop-dead deadline, it points to a dysfunction here. Either the engineering managers are reporting to the wrong people, or the team lacks a strong engineering leader who understands the futility of software estimates and the need for a collaborative give-and-take between engineering and product in order to ensure the flexibility of shipping scaled-back MVPs to hit delivery targets.",
        "Product should own the continuous discovery process. Engineering should own the continuous delivery process. Marketing should work hand-in-hand with the product team to ensure that product messaging to the wider world is on-point. The whole thing should fit together like a pipeline, creating a smoothly flowing, positive feedback cycle. Like an assembly line, the slowest bottleneck in the process must set the pace for the rest of the process, otherwise, it will lead to an ever-growing backlog that piles up so much that backlog items become obsolete, and backlog management becomes a full-time job.",
        "Product teams who feel like engineering is not keeping pace should focus first on quality of engineering hand-off deliverables. Have we done adequate design review? Has an engineer had a chance to provide constructive feedback before handoff? 80% of software bugs are caused by specification or UX design errors, and many of those can be caught before work ever gets handed off to an engineering team. Once you have that process finely tuned, ask yourself if you\u2019ve really explored the product design space thoroughly enough. Did you build one UX and call it done, or did you try multiple variations? Building and testing variations on user workflows is one of the most valuable contributions a product team can make. Do you have a group of trusted users or customers you can run A/B prototype tests with?",
        "One of the biggest dysfunctions of software teams is that the product team is producing sub-par deliverables (sometimes little more than a few rushed, buggy mock-ups), and failing to run any of them by customers or engineers prior to handing them off. That dysfunction causes a pileup of re-work and engineering backlog that often gets blamed on engineering teams.",
        "Make sure that the delegation of responsibilities makes sense, that you\u2019re not putting undue time pressure on engineering, and that you have a great product team engaged in a collaborative product discovery process, working with real users to build the best product.",
        "Engineering managers, I\u2019m not letting you off the hook. If these dysfunctions exist on your team, it\u2019s your responsibility to address them with product, marketing, and business leadership, and spearhead requirements for engineering hand-offs. It\u2019s also your responsibility to protect the productive pace of your team, go to bat for additional resources if your team is being pressured to produce more than your current capacity can handle, to report clearly on the work pacing and backlog, and to demo completed work and ensure that your team is getting due credit for the fine work that is being done.",
        "Don\u2019t place blame, but do demonstrate that your team is doing their very best work.",

        "I started The Pragmatic Engineer Job Board in October 2021. 2.5 years later, I am shutting it down permanently, despite a reasonable success in traction. The shutdown was triggered by my vendor \u2013 Pallet \u2013 discontinuing their job board and talent collective approach. However, I  might have eventually come to the same decision myself, even without Pallet making this call.",
        "In this post, I outline what led here; the results of the job board (and talent collective), and what I learned about the tech jobs market.",
        "My initial motivation with the job board was to add a kind of \"helpful monetization\" to both my blog, and The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter (a few months after I started this newsletter). In the blog \u2013 and at the end of all free newsletter issues \u2013 jobs posted by customers of the job board were shown. Like this:",
        "I accepted posts that scored at least 9/12 on The Pragmatic Engineer Test \u2013 which is a measurement I put together, aiming to put a number against how \"modern\" a company's engineering culture is.",
        "Companies paid $500/month for a job posting or $750/month for two, featured job postings. On top of the ability to post jobs, they had access to The Pragmatic Engineer Talent Collective. This \"collective\" is something that my job board vendor, Pallet, innovated, and it was an instant hit both for companies hiring and for candidates looking for jobs.",
        "Pallet started out as a job board. However, early 2022, the startup innovated with the concept of a \"talent collective.\" The idea was this:",
        "The core insight Pallet had was how people trust \"creators\" \u2013 and how these \"creators\" already have engaged audiences. This is what it looked like, from the outside:",
        "And this is what it looked like, for companies signed up for the collective, from the inside:",
        "I was personally reviewing every candidate application: and for the ones that I approved, I added a note on why this profile is interesting or standout \u2013 often adding details that I assumed some recruiters could miss (such as open source contributions, mentoring outside of work, or interesting and relevant extracurricular activities that I found encouraging to see.)",
        "I spent about 2-3 hours per week vetting inbound candidates. Over time, a friend started to help out with pre-vetting: they spent about 3-4 hours per week vetting, and I spent another ~1 hour per week going through candidates and tweaking comments.",
        "A few months after launching my job board, Stack Overflow Jobs \u2013  the most well-known software engineering jobs board \u2013 announced shutting down, with the effective date of 30 March 2022. As I analyzed this event in The Pragmatic Engineer:",
        "At the time, I saw good traction with my job board just starting out, so I was surprised that Stack Overflow sees no real future in job boards?",
        "Two years later, I now \"get\" why Stack Overflow shut down its jobs products. It was the same reason Pallet pivoted into Talent Collectives. Job boards are an \"ok\" small business to run on the side... but it's a very transactional product:",
        "My job board had an (initial) advantage of lots of qualified candidates applying. My job board was not a standalone board: but it was interesting tech jobs listed at the bottom of my blog and newsletter. As such, companies initially received lots of qualified candidates. The feedback I received was how my job board was far better in quality responses than when the same companies posted on sites like LinkedIn.",
        "Still, the majority of companies working with me never posted a single job! They went for the Talent Collective instead and contacted vetted, senior+ engineers there instead. About 80% of my customers were like this.",
        "I asked a couple of them: why this approach? The responses were typically:",
        "From my perspective, I liked this setup. Companies stayed customers longer, as they were interested in having access to the \"latest drops\" in the talent collective. (A \"drop\" was a new batch of people admitted to this group, which I did every 2-3 weeks). It created a reason for them to be recurring customers, while receiving regular value. Did Pallet really crack the \"what comes after job boards,\" after all? It looked like it, but only for a short while.",
        "A few weeks ago, Pallet sent me a nice message in which they explained that after much internal deliberation, they have made the tough call to shut down talent collectives and job boards. Instead Pallet will focus on their contingency recruiting business, which has been much more promising, business-wise.",
        "At first, I was surprised by this message. But as I reflected on it, I had to admit: I kind of saw this coming. Pallet is a VC-funded company that raised about $3.8M in seed funding. The company's mission is to \"Allow businesses to tap into and hire the talent that hangs out natively in these internet [creator] communities.\"",
        "Pallet's business model was simple: charge a 10% \"cut\" from the money that creators charged for companies hiring (or using the talent collective). Pallet later added an option to charge more for companies where they sourced the tech company, and the tech company decided to \"tap into\" a creator's Pallet.",
        "This 10% cut-rate was a big reason I signed up for Pallet. It seemed like a reasonable price to charge for the infrastructure Pallet built. It's also the same take rate that Substack, my newsletter platform charges. So, for a company signing up for a $750/month package, I made $675, and Pallet made $75.",
        "I observed two troubling trends, though.",
        "#1: \"Creators\" stopped running their Pallet job boards and talent collectives. In early 2022, YouTubers and newsletter writers started to run their Pallet boards by the dozens. As I look back now, about 90% of the people I remembered having a Pallet stopped maintaining it and using it about a year ago.",
        "The truth is: running a job board/talent collective involved recurring, nontrivial amount of work:",
        "#2: Interest in job boards/talent collectives declined, even as traffic displaying these offerings increased. Here are statistics on traffic that ended up on my job board (when people clicked through from my newsletters and blog): and how traffic across my newsletter and blog changed over the same time:",
        "In what is surprising: despite my newsletter generating significantly more traffic (up from ~1M impressions per month to closer to 2.5M per month), and many of these impressions displaying job ads (at the bottom of free emails): the interest in the job board and talent collective decreased.",
        "There was a similar trend in companies paying to access the talent collective and job board. This peaked in 2022, and it has been a slow, but steady decline all the way until now.",
        "In late 2022 and early 2023, I had trouble believing the quantity and quality of candidates applying to the job board. These included:",
        "The surprising part was that all of the above folks likely had an already strong network, and yet they were willing to give this talent collective a go. The reason? This was the period of \"The Great Tech Layoffs\" when:",
        "This period passed \u2013 luckily for the industry, I'll add! Thankfully, we've not seen such a layoff streak since. At the same time, there are much fewer of the above profiles applying to the collective. And, to be fair: why would they do so?",

        "I was lucky enough to run my job board before automated AI applications went mainstream. However, this is starting to happen already. Here's one of the many such startups offering to submit 150 automated applications per day for $99/month:",

The tech industry is a fast-changing one: what works today might not work as well tomorrow.

If I'm honest with myself: it was a distraction away from researching and writing The Pragmatic Engineer. And while doing deepdives into company engineering cultures, or uncovering interesting tech industry trends fill up my bucket: \"rejecting\" companies or candidates for the job board/talent collective; doing customer support for companies on the job board (such as doing full refunds whenever a company did not get a qualified candidate in a month): these were all draining it. If I'm honest with myself: I should have retired the job board/talent collective earlier than I've done so. And so, in a strange way, I'm grateful that Pallet made this decision for me and helped me re-evaluate where I really want to spend my time.",

        "For all the companies who trusted me to help with your hiring: thank you! Pallet has a different model, going forward. Try it out if you find it interesting (I have no affiliation with the company, beyond having been a happy customer for their previous product). Otherwise,  I suggest experimenting with other job boards, or with solutions like LinkedIn, Gem, and others.",

        "So it has nothing to do with winning the job at Google, as I guess so.",
        "Further, by looking at the CV, I can teach you some basics that are psychological points to let you understand what he did and why it worked (remember, it may not work for you as well, fate for everyone is different)",
        "Let\u2019s explore each point in details here.",
        "1) He did not use any kind of introduction in his cv such as I am this and that, I belong to there, or blah blah blah \u2014 he directly listed down his experiences, that\u2019s it!",
        "\u2192 The game here is DIVERT attention of the READER to EXPERIENCES instead of HIM \u2192 so that\u2019s the TRICK!",
        "2) He only listed one current on-going job \u201cpresent\u201d and the one he did previously \u201cimportant one\u201d and cut through the chest \u2014 he didn\u2019t mention any other job to keep clean his CV, I don\u2019t know if he did other jobs but at least we can see only 2 on the list.",
        "Here is the thing, when we hire someone to do our work, we care to know if he/she had ANY KIND OF EXPERIENCE before, or not?",
        "If yes, what were those experiences? He simply listed down and cleared this concept quickly. Two powerful names, Microsoft and Amazon, ordered by descending list.",
        "3) Now, he quickly shown HIS WORK (the credibility, expertise, and ability to do what kind of work, this added instant power to his resume regarding what he is capable off)",
        "When we hire, we want to know the expertise level of someone we want to hire, showing off your projects empower the reader (hiring person) know regarding your capabilities quickly.",

        "Obviously, we want to know what languages or frameworks one is familiar with to work since we don\u2019t want our clients turn away. We need someone who can take care projects in \u201cour desired domain\u201d.",
        "Now for example, if I would be hiring someone for my company, I will prefer to know if he/she capable of doing work with PHP, Classic ASP, Joomla, WordPress, Wix, Smarty, CakePHP, Bootstrap etc relevant to THOSE PROJECTS which I would be targeting from Freelancing marketplaces \u2014 makes sense?",
        "If someone would be listing down projects he has done with using those skills set and also show me his list of skills, I can quickly analyze and understand his capability, sounds easier to hire the one?",
        "The rest is history!",

        "Of course, there are many different opinions. Get as much input from as many sources as you can.",
        "When I look at what you have, with my (only slightly) informed eyes\u2026",
        "It looks pretty good to me, certainly better than a lot of resumes that I see.",
        "I don\u2019t like the gridlines in the Education section - I think it is cleaner without them and I think it clashes with the formatting of everything else.",
        "I would want the \u201clanguages and techs\u201d section to be more prominent. I think that other than your contact info, it is the most important thing. You\u2019ve got 5 seconds for them to decide if they want to keep looking. What languages/techs you do is one of the most important things.",
        "The only thing I\u2019d maybe put above that would be a \u201cSummary\u201d, just a few sentences explaining who you are. \u201cI am a software developer with 3+ years experience, specializing in Java, ASP.NET, and Angular. I am looking for full-time employment. I am open to relocation\u201d.",
        "So, you have your basic contact info, below that a simple summary, and right below that a list of languages/techs. That way within a few seconds they know the most important information they need to decide if it is worth reading the rest of the resume - they don\u2019t have to go looking for it. After that, I\u2019d probably put Employment, Projects, then Education. I suggest that because I think that that is the order of importance to a hirer.",
        "I like that it looks pretty well proof-read. There are a few little things, like If you are going to put a period at the end of bullet points, then they should all have them, like the first Project. And it\u2019s \u201cfantasy football\u201d, not \u201cfootball fantasy\u201d. But still, I like that everything is very well organized and consistent.",
        "I might consider trying to liven up the design a little. Maybe something other than the default bullet point? Maybe another color for the bullet points and/or the topic headings - nothing drastic, just a little bit of color.",
        "I would be curious to explore other formats. Maybe your techs could be bullet points in a sidebar - that would stand out too and make it seem less like top to bottom drudgery.",
        "I like how clear your employment bullet points are so clear and talk about actual things you\u2019ve done, but I might suggest some of that could be tightened up a little, less wordy.",
        "For example, your certification doesn\u2019t need a link and could just be: \u201cSpring & Hibernate for Beginners (including SpringBoot) - Udemy\u201d. You don\u2019t need to include a link and you don\u2019t need to tell them that it is an online course - they know what Udemy is.",
        "I don\u2019t see a link to a portfolio page - I would expect that.",
        "You list TypeScript - I would mention JavaScript - the first round of resume eliminations may be done by an HR person that doesn\u2019t know that TS means that you also do JS. Read through some of the job adverts that you see and see what techs they list - make sure they are on your resume (if you can do them).",
        "I strongly disagree with that. If you mean that you connect with people you don\u2019t know on linkedin and ask them for a referral, that to me seems shady. You are asking a complete stranger go to their boss to put in a good word for you.",
        "That being said, we could modify this a little. Reach out to some of the devs and ask them for advice. \u201cHey, I see that you work for Foobar Corp - I am interested in what you guys do. Do you have any advice on how to get hired there? Are there some techs I should be exploring?\u201d Psychologically, this way you can ingratiate yourself to these people - people like to feel helpful and instinctively feel protective of people that need their help. But \u201chey, you don\u2019t know me, will tell your boss he should hire me\u201d - no, that sounds bad.",
        "A college senior told me that the best and fastest way to get your resume selected for the interview is to directly contact the HR who posted the job on platforms like LinkedIn.",
        "But, he\u2019s in university - why is he an expert on getting hired?",
        "On the other hand, yeah, that can be good advice, as long as it isn\u2019t \u201cgive me the job\u201d, if it\u2019s \u201cI wanted to reach out and introduce myself, as I\u2019m applying for this position. If you have any advice or feedback, it would be greatly appreciated. I hope to be hearing from you.\u201d - something like that makes you seem, professional, courteous, very interested in the job, and interested in developing yourself. Those are all great qualities for a first impression. Even if you don\u2019t get hired for that position, you may stick in their head for something that comes up later.",
        "Employee referrals are given least priority and that proceeds only when the person interviewing has worked in the past with that employee or that employee knows him very well.",

        "I don\u2019t know, for the two companies I\u2019ve worked for during Covid, hiring slowed a little at the beginning, but then went back to normal, except that everything became remote.",
        "Although, my current and previous companies are product-based but both are of small size and doesn\u2019t have a good work culture. Also, I am not satisfied by both quantity as well as quality of work in my current company as work here is too easy for a person of my experience.",
        "That\u2019s all well and good, but remember to be careful to not criticize your old companies and coworkers - you\u2019ll come across as a complainer. Try to be positive about it and look at things as learning opportunities. Try to find at least one thing positive about everything you\u2019ve done.",

        "If I had just out right asked for a job then none of that would have happened.",
        "So, find a way to make  genuine connections and that will increase your chances of getting valuable information on how to land an interview at FAANG.",
        "Hope that helps!",
        "FYI, landing a job at a FAANG company is extremely difficult, and the odds are not in your favor. What I mean is, the odds aren\u2019t in most people\u2019s favors.",
        "Up to thousands of people apply to one position at a FAANG company, and the most likely candidates who get interviews will have gone to an Ivy League university and at least a BS degree in computer science (or highly related field), and graduated at or near the top of their class.",
        "Furthermore, in the event you do get to the first stage, that\u2019s only the beginning. These companies and others like them infamously have 4 (or more) interviews, each of which will get progressively harder. They also all notoriously interview hard for \u201cdata structures and algorithms\u201d knowledge, so if you don\u2019t have a CS degree, that\u2019s something you should be studying.",
        "Also you should know that FAANG companies do not have the gold standard of developer jobs by any means. They are the most stressful companies that you can expect to work in and will expect you to work long hours, probably on weekends, and everyone around you will have exceedingly high expectations. Yes they pay well, but they will demand a lot from you. I\u2019ve heard of many people who were glad to get OUT of these companies because of how long & hard they were forced to work.",
        "The truth is that MOST software companies in general pay at least moderately well for developer jobs. If you need to solve money problems, the fact is that almost any developer job anywhere will do that for you. You don\u2019t need to work at a FAANG company for that.",
        "Also a LOT of companies work on highly scalable software. FAANG companies just tend to have the most well-known apps. There are many, many companies who make all kinds of software running around the Internet delivering something to a LOT of people.",
        "You want to learn? Many companies will help you do that, and you probably have a better chance of learning across a web stack (front-end, back-end, devops, CI/CD, testing, et al) at a smaller company than a bigger one. The larger the company you work at, the less chance you have of \u201cgeneral\u201d learning across a web stack, and you\u2019re more likely to have to learn something very specific instead. Also, smaller companies are more likely to reward you for learning and working on things outside of your role. Managers at FAANG companies would be more likely to reprimand you for working on things outside of your role.",
        "Lots of smaller companies have very well-known reputations too.",
        "If you want spare time to focus on side jobs and personal relationships and hobbies, FAANG companies are the last companies you should be seeking out. It is very well-known they tend to have \u201call-consuming\u201d jobs. You will not have much (if any) time for hobbies or dating (assuming that you are currently single and looking to get married one day).",
        "I\u2019ve heard all of these things from people I know who\u2019ve worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. I\u2019d imagine the other companies to be the same.",
        "Everyone is overqualified.",
        "On LinkedIn, asking employees working in those companies for referral.",
        "This is not a good strategy in general and I would recommend stopping trying to do this. For referrals to work in general, you should know the person you\u2019re contacting - i.e. it should be a friend, someone you went to school with, someone you worked for, or some other type of actual professional acquaintance that you\u2019ve met in person. Asking total strangers for referrals doesn\u2019t usually work because strangers don\u2019t generally refer strangers.",

List down activities or subjects make you feel energized and engaged.\n\n\u2b50Ask seniors and colleagues from diverse industries and professional profiles about their daily activities, responsibilities and leadership exposure.\n\n\u2b50Choose and rate the top 2-3 careers and evaluate them for learning, interest, and compensation. Select the best suited one. \n\n\u2b50Start with your strongest preference by a pilot project, part time internship or a learning course till you are sure of it.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Key Takeaway : Choosing a career path is a personal journey, and it may take time and exploration to find the right fit.

        "Varun Mayya:\u00a0When I was in college at the age of 19, a group of friends and I wanted to start a company. We started selling t-shirts and we called the company Sizr Studios (www.sizr.net). Targeting our class first and then expanding, we made quite a bit of money, close to Rs. 25,000 off the business. However, the effort/risk to reward ratio was very high. So we wanted keep the creative passion flowing but move towards services.",
        "",
        "Survival rate is always much higher with services whereas with products it can be a hit and a miss. So we looked into the hiring industry. Our competitors had been in it for a very long time but we felt they had gotten pretty stale.",
        "We decided to create a platform that people will actually use and revolutionize the online hiring industry. We saw that the way companies were hiring was in fact quite boring. We wanted to make that a fun process, so our vision initially was \u201cAspire to find a job you truly love\u201d.",
        "After the initial idea in the 7th semester, we got accepted as a company in an incubator where we made a lot of contacts as well. We started building our product by mapping out customer journeys, how things should flow etc.",
        "",
        "CE: How did you come across your co-founders? What unique skills did each one of them bring in?",
        "Varun Mayya: I met all of my co-founders in college. Kartik was with me since Sizr and Mohak joined after a few weeks worth of brainwashing. Sandesh joined me the second I pitched Jobspire to him. It was a star studded team - I\u2019d handle vision, risk and training; Sandesh would do product; Mohak would do sales and Kartik would handle the technical side of things.",

        "CE: What kind of research & planning went on before starting up Jobspire?",
        "Varun Mayya:\u00a0We didn\u2019t do much research initially, but as we started building the product, we came across a lot of questions that needed to be answered in order to go forward with the product designs. That\u2019s where most of our research came in. We didn\u2019t understand recruiters at all and it took us nearly 100+ calls with recruiters to even understand the breadth and depth of the market - it\u2019s huge.",
        "",
        "CE: How did you gather the initial funds required to set up Jobspire?",
        "Varun Mayya: We\u2019d made nearly 30 lakhs with Sizr and we pooled most of the same money straight into Jobspire. We registered the company and since then there was no looking back.",

        "We want to give a visual description and we think that people are important and we went with that mindset. We believed very strongly in our product and went forward to test it. Kartik, Sandesh and I come from a tech background and so we came up with the test designs very fast. In the first 3 months we pivoted ideas and business models at least 20-30 times.",

We want to make a careers graph, where we can help people find information on certain career paths all in one place. In order to help candidates make a perfect CV, we are also looking into building a CV maker in the future. By this we hope to build an entire recruitment ecosystem.",

We give a differentiation to these small companies looking to hire talent. Applicants can find a whole new array of companies that they didnt know existed, i.e, we helped with recruiter discoverability.",
        "For the recruiters, we give them a pipeline of top talent. We make sure they have a Jobspire seal ensuring that they\u2019re good. We match companies to the talent they are looking for and this makes the recruiter\u2019s job much easier.",

However, we\u2019d built a great network by the time we built our product, so we had the first 20-30 companies use the platform on a promise that we\u2019d help them hire in a few months. Most of our early adopters still use Jobspire and that\u2019s a great validation of how far we\u2019ve come. Today, we work with 300+ companies and they come to us to post jobs, not the other way round!",

Can you imagine - 4 young students switching to a city we\u2019d never been to before while all our peers were getting placed? It was immense pressure on all of us from peers, teachers, parents, etc to take a job and it didn\u2019t help that we were already getting really good job offers. Statistically, almost no pure tech company has raised the kind of money we did right out of college - so we kinda did the impossible.",

Earlier, we used to pitch just a story and hard resolve to investors but these days we have hard numbers to back our pitches up - if you look for \u201cstartup jobs india\u201d, Jobspire is your first result and in terms of traffic, we\u2019re neck and neck with companies like Hiree, etc.",

        "We have algorithms that put applicants into various buckets depending on their experience and their ability to be an asset in that industry and our curation goes up to 4 different levels.",
        "We focus a lot on showcasing a company's culture through attractive profiles using photos of the workplace and the people who work there. This helps a company to create a talent brand to attract the right kind of talent. It\u2019s always nicer for applicants to be able to have a visual understanding of the company they apply to.",

        "Varun Mayya:\u00a0In hindsight, if there was something different I would do, I\u2019d build Jobspire when I was a bit older. It is a huge task for a 21-22 year old to handle and at this point you are still figuring out your life - sometimes I feel like I missed out on having fun without worrying about something or the other. The only issue of starting a company a little later is finding co-founders.",

        "Varun Mayya:\u00a0We raised from some pretty great and well known investors in the circuit. We built our round very methodically and each of our investors brings something different to the table. We brought Ravi from Purvi Capital on as our lead investor and other investors bought into the idea, the vision and product traction and signed on too. By the end of the round we were oversubscribed and had to choose which investors to leave out of the round. In the beginning we were still learning the art of the pitch, but after over 200+ pitches things come naturally to us. These days we get invited to pitch events and partners at different VCs try to reach out us instead of the other way round.",

        "All my life I found no other stream capable of really giving me a run for my money but entrepreneurship - true entrepreneurship, when you take responsibility for all your stakeholders - investors, employees, co-founders instead of just worrying about yourself and your successes.",
        "It feels great building a team, watching them grow and evolve and wondering how much you\u2019ve really impacted people. A lot of people claim they want to change the world but few understand it\u2019s a very slow process. In a recent research pilot, we estimated over 1 million people have come in contact with Jobspire\u2019s different offerings. It feels great when you know you\u2019ve done something that has true widespread impact.",
        "For people who are starting up, my advice is usually to discount your idea and work towards building a great team and methodical execution. Ideas are cheap, most companies don\u2019t even do what they did 5 years ago and things change. Surrounding yourself with a solid team and having solid people who grow and evolve with you is the hallmark of every great entrepreneur.",
        "",
        "CE: Any message for your readers?",
        "Varun Mayya: There were several periods in Jobspire\u2019s phase when things were not looking so great, but we stuck through. I feel the most important ability that a founder of a company should have is the ability to stick through, whatever the toll on you is. Once you feel you have other options, you\u2019re finished as an entrepreneur. It is extremely important to not give up. In terms of the idea, be ready to make a prototype of what you feel is right.",
        "In India, having a small user base is easy. The minute you want to scale, you need huge amounts of capital. Also, your team. Make sure you have a very strong team. With a bad team, I wouldn\u2019t have lasted two months. But with a great team like I have now, even if everything fails, we still know how to pivot. Don\u2019t be trapped to your initial vision. The market and your own experience will change, and your vision should change parallely.",
        "In the end, make sure you have fun. It\u2019s lonely being a capital backed founder and you should know very well what you\u2019re getting into. Make sure you\u2019re still devoting time to doing things you love.",

You can also try making a creative resume via Behance or WIX.",
        "Make sure, however, that everything is still easy to read and understand despite being in an unconventional format.",
        "While a resum\u00e9 lists your skills, the\u00a0cover letter explains how these skills match the needs of the position, and gives examples of when and how they were applied\u00a0 In the same way your resum\u00e9 is tailored to fit a particular job opportunity, your cover letter is a detailed response to what the employer is looking for.",
        "State how your skills, abilities, and background make you a suitable candidate for meeting the company's needs.\u00a0Avoid repeating exactly what you already noted in your resum\u00e9. The point of a cover letter is to add value to your application, not duplicate it.",
        "Once your\u00a0resum\u00e9 has gotten you to the interview stage of the recruitment process, be prepared to back up what you\u2019ve written. Expect that your job interview may cover skills-based questions or questions that aim to assess whether your skill set matches the organisation\u2019s requirements.",
        "Recruitment experts recommend highlighting the necessary hard and soft skills. If you encounter a question about skills in the job description that you don\u2019t currently have, let the employer know that you are interested in developing these skills. It shows your willingness to grow and develop in their organisation.",
        "Communication Trainer and Coach Ashira Prossack suggests emphasising how your skills will benefit the company. Let the employer know how your skill set can be an asset for the organisation, highlighting its impact by sharing how it drove change or achieved effective results.",
        "Be ready to provide examples and illustrations. Carousell CEO and Co-Founder Marcus Tan has said that\u00a0he listens to applicants who detail how they were able to solve complex challenges in the past. \u201cIt speaks well of them when they show that they\u2019re proud of these accomplishments, but are still humble enough to acknowledge where they could have done better!\u201d.",
        "For example, if your interviewer asks you about an experience where you led a team, take the opportunity to drop the hard and soft skills that led to your success.",
        "I was the team leader for a conference that involved representatives from different countries. I had a team of 20 and before we began, we created a S.M.A.R.T. goal to help us organise our ideas, tasks, and timelines. I delegated assignments to the members based on their personalities and skill sets.",
        "Once we got started, I immediately opened a conversation in Slack to help us collaborate and converse better. I also logged in everyone\u2019s tasks on Proofhub. This helped our team become more accountable and cognisant of their and each other\u2019s responsibilities. Thanks to planning and concerted efforts, after two months of gruelling work, we were able to hold the conference without a hitch.",
        "In this example, you already show not only your leadership prowess, but also how well you prioritise, delegate, and think strategically and collaboratively. You also demonstrate your knowledge of productivity tools.",
        "As we mentioned earlier, you don\u2019t need to include all the skills in your toolbox to impress your potential employer. Instead, focus on the ones that they need the most and remove the rest. Here are some guidelines on what skills to avoid including in your resum\u00e9:",
        "Highlighting your skills in your resum\u00e9 lets your employer know what you\u2019re capable of. By identifying and outlining your skills in your resum\u00e9, you show the employer that this is what you can do for them. From here, they can assess if you\u2019re a good fit for their organisation or not.",
        "Your skills are your assets. Take stock of the skills you\u2019ve attained by remembering how you developed them, how they made you successful, and how they impacted your work. Be proud of your skills. Ultimately, your skills are what will get you hired and what will help you thrive.",

        "Thank you for your message. I agree that beating the ATS is not a concern if a company has hired a recruiter or hiring manager to read all of the applications. Most companies do not. They post the job announcement in a job board like Indeed and expect the imbedded ATS to list the most qualified candidates based on how well they have matched with the keywords. So, I do not agree that \"every resume is reviewed by a recruiter that meets the requirements set by the job description.\" So, I do my best to write resumes with that in mind. If someone does vet the resumes on the other end, then great, the document will market you well to the reader. ATS software comes in two formats. One is Adobe based coding and one is Microsoft based. The Microsoft based ATS does not read Adobe code well. Many people think they need to send their resume as a PDF to protect it from being changed or to keep formatting, but you take the chance of sending your PDF to a company that uses the Microsoft version. If so, then their software may have trouble reading your resume. Greenhouse, for example, uses the Adobe version and needs a PDF. The U.S. Army uses a Microsoft based one and needs a Word document. If you turn in a PDF to USAJobs, the scan does not let your resume pass if it is a PDF. It is difficult to keep a resume under two pages if you have more than two jobs to list along with certifications, additional training, etc. I will do my best to keep it on two pages when we are finished revision and between 550 and 650 words.",

I will highly recommend to have a recap at the end of each day, and go over what went well and what didn\u2019t that day, and what you are hoping to do tomorrow. And write them! Writing becomes essential when you have different teams under you that are working on completely different projects for the same unified goal. Without keeping a personal track, it is as if you\u2019re conducting an orchestra without the musical notes.",
        "I try to imagine what the end product will look like. How it will function, and why that \u2018idea\u2019 will exist. What problem is it trying to solve? Are there any other products trying to fix that problem? There probably is but what are they lacking? In what ways are they successful? In what ways do they fail? A lot of what I do involves thinking and research, and then I design and prototype. Prototyping is actually when raw thoughts become alive. I then, adjust based on feedback.",
        "It is very important to weed out useful feedback from the naysayers. When you challenge things that people are used to, it is very normal to face some push back. Believe in yourself, however, don\u2019t label everyone who disagrees with you as a naysayer. There\u2019s probably some good feedback in every reaction.",
        "Developments on artificial intelligence. It both excites me and scares me.",
        "Just like JobzMall, I had to gamify my productivity. I have an hourglass and sticky notes on my desk at home and office. Before I start my work, whether it\u2019s UI design, coding, partner relations or content creation I set a time for that work. And then I race myself to do it. If I finish the work before the allocated time, I receive imaginary points. If I don\u2019t, I lose my imaginary points. If I hit a certain milestone, I treat myself to things. It is similar to an arcade with tickets but for work.",
        "Relax. I stressed over so many problems that I foresaw and preemptively created stress over myself and others. I believed being relaxed was being complacent, something that I have a huge problem with. As an entrepreneur, it is my prime responsibility to set and improve processes, so I always look for flaws or try to anticipate where the next problem will arise. I would say: \u201cstay true to yourself, have clear expectations from yourself and others, improve every single day and work hard. Things will be fine.\u201d",
        "It is such a cliche, but It is very very true: Believe in yourself. Have a very well-thought out, researched, debated, strong belief system, and act on it. The world we live in is entirely built by human mind. It wasn\u2019t built by minds that posses mental powers that you do not. You can change it for the better, as long as you act on it. You will encounter a lot of naysayers, and it is very normal. They will reject your ideas because you challenge what they know today based on their learnings of yesterday. Yet you are architecting tomorrow, it is only natural to encounter friction. Believe in yourself, and work hard on it.",
        "Don\u2019t forget why you are doing what you are doing. Remind yourself over and over again. Over time your business will evolve, your problems will change, and things will get hard. Very hard. \u2018What\u2019 you do will change. It is very easy to lose track of the \u2018why,\u2019 however, you need to derive strength from your purpose and stay true to yourself. Your problems will fall one after another if you always remind yourself of the purpose.",
        "Listen to people and offer help. It is very easy to look out just for your needs, but that\u2019s a recipe for loneliness. Everyone in the world has hopes and plans for the future. Listen to them. See where you can help them achieve their goals. There is nothing more noble than helping another person for a good cause. This will allow you to open so many doors at different stages in your life. In business, think about the value you are delivering to your customers, deliver them now and think about the money later. If you are best at what you do for others, you will make money, but money shouldn\u2019t be your focus.",
        "When I started JobzMall, I knew extremely little about so many things. This caused me to form the team three times from scratch and endure many problems. I overcame them by viewing my work as a learning experience. I try to learn and improve every single day and make decisions based on what I know and believe the most at the time. Remembering the core purpose \u2013 the \u2018why\u2019 \u2013 helped me not lose direction. I hired people that are excellent at what they do and created an environment where they can perform at their best \u2013 and while doing so, learn from them.",
        "In the early days, some told me it was a dream to develop the platform. After all, I had no prior experience. Nor the required network to challenge a very mature industry. Now the same people that doubted me, praise JobzMall on our audacity and traction. Do not let failure demotivate you. LEARN from your mistakes and never make them again. Having mentors you talk to on a regular basis is very key in improving yourself. A knowledgeable outside perspective always helps.",
        "A \u201cSmart City\u201d like Amazon Go really excites me. Having houses that have Alexa in every room, a city watched over, governed by a singular consciousness. It may be a scary thought, but so was talking to someone on the other side of the world through a device 100 years ago, and doing so for free 10 years ago. Although the entire concept would be unachievable by a single person, the pieces that would be included in this giant project are very achievable. Maybe a software that detects when your favorite grocery is running out of your refrigerator and automatically replenishes them through Amazon?",

        "Though, it is the celebrities, politicians and athletes we venerate as a society, it is the progress on science and engineering that shapes the medium of how we operate and communicate. If it wasn\u2019t for nerdy teens coding the social media platforms that we use today, we wouldn\u2019t be following these celebrities. Developments on artificial intelligence will be the biggest events in human history. It will affect every aspect of human life just like internet has done, but even on a more dramatic scale. I highly recommend this book and understanding the topic.",

Sure, sometimes hiring managers are swamped with candidates (or simply disorganized) and don't respond to every applicant. But recent research has shown that lots of job postings are ghost jobs: listings for roles that an organization has no intention of filling, at least not imminently.",

        "It\u2019s tough to determine how many apparently open jobs are actually ghosts, because most companies don\u2019t want to admit to the practice (Stack Overflow, for the record, does not post ghost jobs). The Great Resignation and the economic uncertainty of the pandemic years increased the number of ghost jobs, according to a Harvard Business School report. One widely cited survey of 649 hiring managers found that almost 40% of hiring managers said their companies posted ghost jobs this year, ranging from entry-level roles to positions in the C-suite.",

As Kara Dennison wrote in Forbes last fall, \u201cposting a job description without the intention to immediately start the hiring process inflates the true number of jobs in the market and elongates the job search, much to the frustration of many job seekers.\u201d Dennison is referring to the Job Openings and Labor Market Turnover Survey (JOLTS) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported 9.6 million available jobs in September 2023, a figure that she writes \u201cleft many questioning why hiring numbers seemed so low despite increasing job openings.\u201d The answer, Dennison explains, is that \u201c\u2018job opening\u2019 [means] something different than what job seekers expect: a current open job that one can apply to and expect to be interviewed for and potentially hired.\u201d Some of those \u201cjob openings\u201d\u2014make that a lot of them\u2014are ghosts.",

If a candidate knows they\u2019re applying or interviewing for a theoretical future role instead of a specific position a company is looking to fill ASAP, that\u2019s one thing. But the lack of transparency rubs most potential candidates the wrong way, especially when they\u2019ve devoted time and energy to interviews.

        "I had the pleasure of speaking with Juju Journey Brener about her role in Vanquish, available in select theaters and Apple TV April 16.",
        "We also discuss the ups and downs of being a child actor and how the COVID lockdowns have affected her.",
        "VANQUISH will be available in Select Theaters on April 16th and on Apple TV, and Everywhere You Rent Movies on April 20th! Available on Blu-ray and DVD on April 27th!",
        "Yanis: You did an incredible job portraying Lily. What was your process like preparing for this role?",
        "Juju: Thank you so much! I watched Midnight Run and Bad Boys which are the director George Gallo\u2019s movies.",
        "I read the script with my Mom, marked it all up and also researched kids with illnesses and decided on a back story for Lily because it was not specified what illness she has.",
        "Y: Tell me about a moment or a scene that was particularly intense or memorable.",
        "J: Two scenes that were memorable were: the pool because the location we shot at had this amazing turquoise indoor pool and I love swimming.",
        "I also loved the end part in the car when we drive off to our future. We shot inside a real Mclaren \u2014 sports cars are cool, this one was really amazing. I\u2019ve never been inside one of those before.",
        "Y: What was it like filming in Mississippi? Had you been there before?",
        "J: Before filming Vanquish I had never been to Mississippi but always wanted to go to the South. It was amazing to film in Biloxi ! We were on the beach and the water was warm and super shallow, even when you swam far. I got to spend time there on days off.",
        "I also really loved the food. I ate Grits every day! So yummy! I also loved corn bread, fried oysters, key lime pie and fried pickles. Also the people are so nice and friendly.",
        "Y: What was it like filming with Ruby Rose? How did the two of you go from being strangers to having a completely believable parent-child relationship on screen?",
        "J: Filming with Ruby was super cool! She is so talented and beautiful. I knew she played Batwoman and that is awesome.",
        "We didn\u2019t have much time to prepare with each other, but as soon as we started rehearsing and hanging out in Biloxi she was just really friendly and nice, and as actors we\u2019re trained to know how to make relationships work on screen.",
        "From the first scene I just started hugging her and holding her hand and in my mind I pretended she was my real Mom, to make it believable. This is what I learned to do through studying acting.",
        "Y: What did you learn from working with Morgan Freeman?",
        "J: I learned that sometimes even if it\u2019s a big or important scene you only get to do 2 takes and that you have to really nail it and be good on the first or second one. His acting is very subtle, that inspired me and I like that because that is what I always try to do.",
        "Y: I think a lot about how COVID is affecting children. What was the adjustment to lockdown like initially for you and your friends?",
        "J: At first it was weird because I didn\u2019t see my friends for a long time and I was sad because I couldn\u2019t go to dance classes.",
        "I\u2019m also a dancer and before COVID I would dance many hours a week. I couldn\u2019t go to the movies which I love and was home a lot. But it made me work harder on school, reading and speech because I had more time and I got much better at those things.",
        "I also made a garden with my sister, painted a lot with my Dad (he is a contemporary artist) and played video games with my friends remotely. My family says that I matured a lot during this time.",
        "I\u2019m happy things are opening up, as I got to travel to Miami and recently also went skiing in Mammoth with my friends. Dance is back too, so that is super awesome.",
        "Y: Parents of child actors (and aspiring child actors) are dying to know: how do you balance the professional side of the relationship while prioritizing the parent-child relationship?",
        "J: In our family\u2019s case it\u2019s a bit different because our parents know the industry. My Mom was an actor and producer for many years, and my Dad was a manager, writer and producer. My sister is also an actor. My Mom is also a consultant and coach so she helps other actors and families.",
        "My Mom helps us a lot with all our schedules, scripts, auditions, shoots, characters, and all work related stuff.",
        "But both our parents are also just regular parents that make us breakfast, drive us to school, help with homework, do our laundry and yell at us when we\u2019re lazy and don\u2019t clean after ourselves or leave food in our rooms.",
        "We spend lots of time together and travel to cool places like Thailand, or Miami and make it a point to do fun things like beach days, ride bikes, snow skiing or zip lining that have nothing to do with Hollywood stuff.",
        "Y: What are you looking forward to doing most once COVID is over? Was it something you used to take for granted?",
        "J: I was really looking forward to going back to be able to go to the movies, go skiing and to Six Flags, but now that things are opening I just went skiing and it was amazing and next up is Six Flags and Vanquish in an actual theater!",
        "I don\u2019t think I took it for granted I think I just didn\u2019t realize one day it could all shut down. I\u2019m definitely happy I can do things I love again.",
        "Y: What are your long term goals in this industry?",
        "J: My goals are to be a series regular on a Netflix show, a Disney Show, to star in many movies both comedies and dramas with actors I like, like Ben Stiller, Liam Neeson, Aiden Gallagher and Angelina Jolie .",
        "I also want to make music, sing and perform. I also love doing animation so I\u2019m sure I will do lots more of that. I definitely want to win an Oscar and a Golden Globe.",
        "Y: I know you\u2019ll win those awards and many awards. Don\u2019t forget to thank me in your acceptance speeches!",
        "Do you have any words of wisdom for aspiring child actors and their parents?",
        "J: You have to work really hard and often in odd hours and on the weekends and know that you will be juggling school and life while being a working kid at same time.",
        "You will often have to miss out on certain things so unless you\u2019re willing to do that it\u2019s probably not the right thing for you.",
        "You have to really love it and want to do it and have a good attitude and get along with people on sets. You also have to be able to deal easily with rejection because many roles you audition for you don\u2019t get. I also recommend getting in a great acting class because you have to be really good to succeed.",

We are making more appointments than ever in our history. Our weekly meeting is now mostly a celebration of new hires - the whole hiring lead team looks at every new hire's resume and talks over the process of hiring that candidate, then discusses improvements to the process. We are able to analyse the data in our hiring process and look for any indications of bias at each stage, then engage and address it if we have concerns.You ask if the \"CEO is pushing for a candidate\" biases the process. You misunderstand my role as hiring lead. I am not pushing for a candidate, I am simply running a few roles as a hiring lead. My job as a hiring lead is to do the initial lightweight screen, then let the process do the work. I don't meet candidates in my roles until the very end of the process, and then only sometimes. I'm running the process to hire for other managers, not for myself. Those managers meet the candidates in late-stage interviews. My job as hiring lead is to make sure we have a good bench of candidates before we make an offer.Some of the roles I run, which attract the bulk of the applicants, are open-ended roles, for \"engineering manager\" or \"engineering lead\". When candidates get to me in those roles, if I think they are great I then send them to a manager who is looking for someone like that. So it has been my great pleasure to give tens of amazingly great candidates to my colleagues for consideration for roles they hadn't even started to hire for. Think how nice that feels, for me and for that manager :)To circle back to the beginning - beware the trap of \"normal\".

We tend not to hire in the most expensive locations because we get fantastic talent who live in less polluted, congested and occasionally self-important environments.We do pay competitively; we have hired people out of FAANGs, and we constantly benchmark pay against our market data around the world. True remote work is worth an extra 20%, and quality of colleagues and focus is priceless. We also rigorously assess pay raises for gender equity.* Who was the person coming up with the interview questions?That would be me, mostly. I generally would have reviewed them, though occasionally some slip by.Some of the role-specific questions would be from the hiring lead on the role, who is usually a senior person in that part of the business who has been through an onboarding process run by our global head of HR and me, and who handles applications for multiple jobs. These hiring leads are less susceptible to bias, and more experienced, than first-level managers, and it frees the first-level managers to focus on their teams and get good at being managers.* What is that person's psychological profile?If you are asking about my psychometric profile, I scored 94 on the test we use.

Ran several experiments in space, including the first stem cell experiments, which helped shape stem cell therapy research here on earth. Started a foundation which has funded tens of social change leaders working in health, digital, civil society and environmental areas. Started Ubuntu to democratise access to open source, made some mistakes but stuck with it to help Canonical survive and now thrive. Learned not to yell at people, learned to hire, hired hundreds of people.

The argument is basically \"a biased and obnoxious hiring manager could misuse that data to make biased and stupid hiring decisions\". Yeeeeeees. Obviously.The psychometric test we use is a series of numbers covering different aspects; it's simplistic, but not as simplistic as I reflected with a single number.Hiring leads often progress a candidate that didn't ace that test because they see evidence of excellence in other data. And I often reject offers to candidates who aced that test because I think the result doesn't gel with reality, although I will usually interview a candidate if I have concerns about an offer.",

We can more fully and fairly assess those who show they are willing to do some work to be part of our company.Second, it helps address bias. The written interview is not a resume, which a hiring manager would read through bias like \"I recognise that university\" and \"I like that country\". The written interview is anonymous work, which can be assessed more objectively. We get it assessed, twice, anonymously, in the common case.

So for those candidates who show they care, they have insights, and they are quick on the uptake, we can spend a lot more time on them.Fourth, it helps avoid repetition.

        "Recently, I came across Lensa AI, a photo and video editing tool by Prisma labs, inc on the App Store. I was quickly drawn to its magic avatars generating feature. Transitioning from a former arts manager to a digital designer, I\u2019ve grown accustomed to AI visual generation tools like DALL-E and Disco Diffusion. These tools allow me to bring to life images I can only articulate through prompts, images that I struggle to physically manifest with brush and paint on canvas. The ongoing debate over AI-generated drawings versus those created by human artists notwithstanding, I remain in awe of the sophistication these AI image generators offer, not to mention the significant reduction in time and resources required to bring my visions to life.",
        "AI visual generator has become so accessible that for $3.99, we could easily generate 50 avatars \u201cpainted\u201d by AI engine based on portraits of ourselves on our Mac or iPhone. Another photo editor and AI avatar generator, Facetune, was also advertised to me after I downloaded Lensa to my phone. I was curious to evaluate the quality of the AI avatars produced by these apps and to discern any differences between them, given their comparable costs.",
        "Original Portraits",
        "Okay. Before we start, let me quickly share a little about myself. I am an Asian (Chinese) female (as you could probably tell) in the age between 25 to 30. Both Lensa and Facetune required me to upload 10 to 20 clear images of myself in a fairly short distance without any objects blocking my face to generate those avatars. I don\u2019t have many pictures of myself posing individually, so I took 7 selfies from different angles within the same day and uploaded them to the generators, thinking that the result images would be more accurate.",
        "Facetune AI Avatars",
        "I first tested the AI Avatars tool in Facetune. After uploading my images to its platform, I was asked to indicate my gender and choose my bundle size and payment method. For the most basic bundle, Facetune creates 50 avatars with 10 variations of 5 styles for $3.99 plus tax. I made the payment and the window was minimized into a tab, saying that it is creating the avatars for me. I waited for a really long time wondering if there was any errors in my images or if I should close the app as the tab showed nothing but \u201ccreating avatars for you\u201d. So, I decided to keep the app running in the background and crossed my fingers.",
        "I waited OVERNIGHT and finally received the AI avatars in Facetune. To be honest, I raised my eyebrows when I saw the avatars and was super disappointed by the results. Fairly speaking, the AI engine in Facetune detected my headshape and facial features pretty well and the smiles of those avatars are really close to how the would look on my face in the real life. I also uploaded only 10 images of me, which is far less than the maximum 20 images I could have uploaded to Facetune (maybe that would improve Facetune\u2019s AI performace). Judging from this batch of avatars, there are somethings that the AI tool in Facetune is clearly lacking such as the accuracy in detecting the age and ethnicity of the human and small skin lesions like the mole I have next to my eye. I could not find one single image that looks 99% or even 95% like me (particularly the ones in Y2K style). Well, maybe these three, which were my final three picks after scanning through this bundle.",
        "Lensa AI Avatars",
        "I was thinking to myself maybe I have just wasted $3.99 at this point, but I decided to give AI another chance with Lensa AI. Similar to Facetune, Lensa asked me to upload 10 photos of myself within the same criteria. It added an extra step for me to choose between humans and animals before everything started. One feature I found really helpful is that Lensa would notify me if any of the uploaded photos does not qualify to its requirements and ask me to select more photos for better results.",
        "In the next step, Lensa also asked me to identify my gender. It also allowed me to select 10 styles out of 15 for my final avatar renders, which gave me more flexibility in adjusting the aesthetic of visuals according to my personal preference. If you are a subscriber to Lensa, you could have full access to other features with up to 50% off and generate 50 unique avatars with $3.99. After submitting my payment, I was prompted to a timer and was given the option to get notified by Lensa when it finished painting my avatars.",
        "Compared to Facetune which swapped my face to another body in most of the images, the AI Avatars tool in Lensa worked more like a photo editor, adding some sorts of animation- and pencil-drawing touch to my original images. The avatars\u2019 faces looked more accurate this time, and Lensa did a good job in capturing the surroundings in my original portraits. However, the facial features of some of those avatars looked really artificial and distorted.",
        "I picked six avatars that I like most in this batch of AI generated images. When I compared these two AI Avatars tools, I would definitely agree that Lensa did a better job in replicating my facial features. I was also more satisfied with the general aesthetic and personal \u201cvibes\u201d of the final avatars in Lensa. A great feature of Lensa is that it gives you the option to download your avatars in 4K resolution (4096 x 4096), which may come in handy if you aim for high image quality. Still, neither of them successfully captured the mole I have on my face.",
        "So which is more powerful, Facetune or Lensa?",
        "From a UX/UI standpoint, I found the interfaces of both apps to be clean and user-friendly. However, my recommendation leans towards Lensa for generating AI avatars, primarily because it offered more guidance and creative control throughout the avatar creation process, enhancing the overall quality of its final output. Interestingly, I observed that the distortion of facial features in some of Lensa\u2019s avatars could potentially be minimized by supplying more reference images. Additionally, the inclusion of a countdown timer indicating the remaining processing time significantly enriched my user experience with Lensa, particularly after navigating through the ambiguity and frustration encountered while using Facetune. The lack of clarity on rendering times and the implications of closing the app mid-process with Facetune left me feeling uncertain. In contrast, Lensa provided a more reassuring experience for a newcomer to its features, at an equivalent price point.",
        "Exploring the AI Avatars feature in both apps was an intriguing exercise, allowing me to see my likeness reimagined creatively. Yet, like many others, I find myself contemplating the future role of AI in the arts. The capability of an AI like Lensa to produce 50 distinct images of myself, replete with detail, in just 18 minutes \u2014 a task impossible for me as an amateur painter \u2014 was both impressive and slightly daunting. This experience has left me curious about how professional artists and other art enthusiasts perceive the burgeoning capabilities of AI.",
        "As AI continues to evolve, the necessity for human thought and design remains a question. Why invest more in human effort when machine learning can achieve similar outcomes more efficiently? While the growing battles among AI engines may hint at an impending competition between humans and machines, the outcome remains uncertain. Who knows what the future holds?",

        "Leaving aside the fact that '4-day work week' made both lists, it's also clear that terms like 'polyworking', 'project work', or 'project-based' did NOT make the list. Obviously, this is not a representative sample and you could question whether this methodology is the most relevant. As for me? I'm more interested in figuring out if the above concepts are compatible with a project-based approach to work. For the most part, it seems they are.",
        "It's one thing to talk trends, though, and another to look at how workplaces actually function. I have no doubt that more people are combining multiple projects instead of working for a single employer. Digital nomads have made freelancing and contract work 'cool'\u2014and for those who choose this lifestyle, this is a positive development! For more traditional career types who have been pushed into gig work or part-time contract roles that don't come with full benefits, it may feel more like a sham.",
        "It seems to me that project-based and role-based approaches can co-exist. Some people work best when they can focus on one long-term role at a company that offers career advancement opportunities and a stable income. A subset prefer to juggle a range of changing projects and employers.",
        "Anyway, what's stopping employers from offering some employees a project-based experience? Can you imagine a full-time role where you can follow your interest across teams, responsibilities, and company objectives while wearing multiple hats? I can\u2014in fact, it's exactly how most start-ups operate.",
        "Clearly, the future of work will be decided by workers themselves. Some will polywork\u2014and that's okay.

        "So what does HR do?\u00c2",
        "There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive difference between a healthy human resources department that contributes to the growth of the organization and a distant HR that exists somewhere near the basement archives and only pops up once a year for the company holiday party.\u00c2",
        "Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an in-depth description of what the HR department does (or what they should be doing)\u00c2\u00a0to meet the needs of employees.\u00c2",
        "In simplest terms, the HR (Human Resources) department is a group who is responsible for managing the employee life cycle (i.e., recruiting, hiring, onboarding, training, and firing employees) and administering employee benefits.",
        "Ask any employee what an HR department is, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get an answer that primarily deals with the most uncomfortable aspects of work: HR violations, layoffs, and firing. But the truth is that human resources is there to support employees. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite literally a resource for humans.\u00c2",
        "Here are some of the tasks your HR department is busy completing every day.",
        "HR needs to understand the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs and make sure those needs are met when recruiting for new positions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as simple as just throwing an ad up on Indeed: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to analyze the market, consult stakeholders, and manage budgets.\u00c2",
        "Then, once the role is advertised, more research needs to be done to make sure that the right candidates are being attracted and presented. Recruiting is a massive\u00e2\u0080\u0094and costly\u00e2\u0080\u0094undertaking; the right candidate can revitalize an entire organization, but the wrong candidate can upend operations.",
        "Plan a more effective recruitment process\u00c2\u00a0with these 6 essential steps.",
        "Human resources is in charge of arranging interviews, coordinating hiring efforts, and onboarding new employees. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also in charge of making sure all paperwork involved with hiring someone is filled out and making sure that everything from the first day to each subsequent day is navigated successfully.",
        "Payroll is its own beast. Every payday must have taxes calculated and hours collected. Expenses need to be reimbursed and raises and bonuses need to be added in as well. If you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chore doing taxes just once a year, imagine what it must be like to be in HR and make sure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re properly deducted every pay period.\u00c2",
        "This responsibility may be why HR tends to get a bad rap. When navigated inappropriately, disciplinary actions can lead to the loss of a valuable employee and can even result in litigation or a poor reputation. But when handled appropriately, disciplinary action can result in the success of an employee.",
        "For instance, if a company notices that a particular employee is routinely late and continues being late even after the employee has received several warnings, HR could step in and investigate the reason for the tardiness. It may be an opportunity to extend benefits such as counseling to the employee or offer additional resources to help the employee learn to be on time. Instead of taking on the cost of firing and then recruiting a replacement for that employee, it could be a learning opportunity that could enhance that employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career.",
        "On the other hand, sometimes disciplinary action isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best course to take and an employee should be let go. The best human resources departments know when an employee isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the right fit for a company and would be happier somewhere else. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to HR to develop a strong enough relationship with managers and employees alike to identify the cohesiveness and health of a team.",
        "The disciplinary process can be tough. \nLearn how to give consistent warnings and feedback to improve performance.",
        "Policies need to be updated (or at least examined) every year as the organization changes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job to make official updates to policies and to suggest changes to policies when they no longer serve the company or the employees. Sometimes a policy should be updated as a reaction to an occurrence. HR should always be included in and consulted with regarding these decisions.",
        "Maintaining HR records is mandated by law. These records help employers identify skill gaps to help with the hiring process and to analyze demographic data and comply with regulations. They also contain personal details and emergency contacts for each employee.\u00c2",
        "Staying competitive is of prime importance when trying to attract the best talent. A promising recruit may choose a different company with lesser pay if the benefits are more attractive. HR should routinely investigate similar companies to see if their benefits are competitve.",
        "Besides the seven examples above, which are mostly operational responsibilities, HR provides less quantitative functions: It exists to help employees thrive.\u00c2",
        "After all, employees are the single biggest asset to any organization. It follows, then, that protecting their well-being is of utmost importance. Here are four ways HR helps support the emotional and career needs of employees:",
        "Stagnation is bad for business, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smart to keep your best employees with the company. HR can provide career paths to help guide each employee to a long future within the company. HR can then check in periodically to further guide employees on their career paths.\u00c2",
        "Sometimes the career growth mentioned above requires additional training. Your organization may provide educational assistance, and HR can help determine which classes and training programs would be best for an employee on his or her designated career path. HR can also work with managers to ensure that the employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work schedule is flexible enough to allow the employee to attend classes.",
        "Managers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t born. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re created. HR can help provide management guidance to managers, making sure that department and teams are as healthy and functional as possible. This may include periodically sending managers to formal trainings and retreats.",
        "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember that employees are people. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need help weathering mental illness, health issues, debt, pregnancies, adoption, and myriad other life occurrences. HR can help support employees through any of these and other circumstances.",
        "An HR department that never interacts with employees isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing its job. While you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re developing an onboarding procedure, educate new employees on when to reach out to HR and what resources HR has to offer. The HR department should regularly schedule one-on-one interviews with employees to check in on their career progression, comfort in their roles, and any other issues the employee may be having.\u00c2",
        "Considering these responsibilities, employees should feel comfortable reaching out to their HR departments in these, and similar, situations:",
        "The human resources department heavily contributes to a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture. If HR genuinely cares about the well-being of employees, the culture will be one of openness and growth.\u00c2",

        "Update: See an update on our progress in my August update.",
        "I\u2019ve been quiet lately, and that\u2019s because I\u2019ve joined OpenSesame as Vice President of Engineering. It\u2019s been a fascinating opportunity to rebuild an engineering organization from the inside, and I\u2019m loving every minute. We\u2019re introducing a lot of cutting-edge software development practices, such as self-organizing vertically-scaled teams and Extreme Programming.",
        "As you might expect, introducing these changes to an organization with [REDACTED] number of engineers has been challenging. (I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m allowed to say how many engineers we have, so let\u2019s just say \u201clots,\u201d but not \u201ctons.\u201d Bigger than a breadbox, anyway. Enough that I don\u2019t do any coding myself, and the managers that report to me don\u2019t have time to do much either.)",
        "What I\u2019m really doing is changing the engineering culture at OpenSesame. Culture doesn\u2019t change easily. It tends to snap back. True change involves changing hundreds of little day-to-day decisions. That\u2019s hard, even when people want to make those changes, and full buy-in is hard to come by. I\u2019ve hired several XP coaches to help, but even they\u2019re stretched thin.",
        "This is where the new career ladder comes in. OpenSesame had a pretty innovative approach to career development before I joined. It involved a spreadsheet where engineers would gather evidence of their skills. Each piece of evidence contributed towards an engineer\u2019s promotion. It did a nice job of being objective (or at least, as objective as these things can be) and clear about expectations.",
        "The new career ladder builds on the ideas of the previous spreadsheet to introduce the changes I want. Where the old spreadsheet focused on individual ownership and investigating new technologies, the new one emphasizes teamwork, peer leadership, and maintainable code.

When you become a leader of the software engineering team, you can be sure that sooner or later you will be asked with similar ones by your teammates.",
        "Big and well-structured companies usually have career ladders clearly defined (check, for example, Google\u2019s L1-L10 or Monzo\u2019s progression framework). But what if you work for a fast-growing company, you have just become one of its first leaders, and you are the one who will need to build the ladder from scratch? The company changes rapidly, headcount is going to double or triple in next year, and you have no more than your experience, blank sheet of paper, and a pen. It\u2019s pretty much my story. If you are in the same place, be prepared for a ride and fasten your seatbelt. Defining expectations regarding software engineering roles will be very challenging but also rewarding and eye-opening if you put your whole heart in it.",
        "To make it simpler for you, here I\u2019m sharing my very subjective list of expectations in the simplest career ladder \u2014 junior, regular, and senior software engineer. Of course, this list won\u2019t work for everyone. I went through many similar articles in the past and didn\u2019t find one that matched my expectations and my company\u2019s culture in 100%. Yet still, the more alternative points of view, the better. Btw, don\u2019t hesitate to share your feedback, especially if you strongly disagree or agree with some of my points.",
        "Important note: my list of expectations doesn\u2019t say much about technical competences. I tried to make it as general as possible and focused mostly on soft skills. I don\u2019t underestimate hard skills, but they are always specific to the company. I assume that you know them very well.",
        "For me, tech skills are a baseline. When joining my team, you should have essential technical knowledge about solutions and patterns that we use in our software development process. But you are hired not for who you are and what you know at the moment. In my team, you will be hired for the potential of who you may become.",
        "The key question is \u2014 how will you make our product, but also the team and the workplace better?",
        "Today people should be hired for change, and in that matter, soft skills are essential.",
        "To make it easier to read, I split this post into three parts. Below you can read about my expectations for Junior software engineer position.",
        "Take a look at other articles for:",
        "In my team, this role has a strict time frame. You cannot stay in a junior position for longer than one year. If you don\u2019t grow out of this role within that time, it means that you and I haven\u2019t done our job correctly. I don\u2019t like to call it underperformance, but rather a mismatch. A company cannot fully benefit from your potential, but at the same time, it doesn\u2019t help you to grow effectively.",
        "Within 12 months, we will close two performance review cycles, where you and I will define and then review your long term goals. These objectives are composed of the company\u2019s needs and your self-development plans. In the meantime, we will also spend quite a large number of hours talking one-to-one about how you are doing with these, and how I/your team/company can support you with the accomplishment.",
        "When you are hired as a software engineer, your job isn\u2019t just to write code but to solve problems. Knowledge about algorithms, data structures, design patterns and the experience with programming languages is your toolkit. Of course, it is always better to have more tools in a box, and your performance strongly correlates with a deep understanding of them. But there are two soft skills on top of that which I will require from you \u2014 problem solving and flexibility. In a junior position, it\u2019s common that we don\u2019t even know what we don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s why, in the beginning, you will be responsible for everything in our project \u2014 writing, testing and reviewing code, release management, data analysis, UI/UX consultation and much more. You will do code maintenance, build product features, contribute to tech stack long term goals.",
        "You have one year deadline and so many responsibilities... How on earth can you accomplish all of that and become a regular-level software engineer while keeping you work/life balance healthy?",
        "After hiring, you automatically become a team member. It can be a cross-functional team (people from different departments with complementary skills to deliver working product), or technical team (e.g., backend engineers or Android engineers). If none of those, the entire company is your team now.",
        "Joining a team isn\u2019t easy. Unfortunately, education systems still don\u2019t do much to teach us effective cooperation. At the same time, there are many proves that teams are way more effective than the bunch of individuals. That\u2019s why for me, your contribution to teamwork is not optional. You will need to learn how to build common codebase, make other teammates\u2019 life easier, follow standards. All of these ASAP \ud83d\udc49\u231a.",
        "The team is also here to help you succeed. As a junior, you will get many tasks that can be too hard for you to accomplish. And very often, this is on purpose. You need to know how to ask for help and be helpful for others. How not to ruin your teammates\u2019 productivity by never-ending questions and how not to be blocked for ages with your job.",
        "Side note: I encourage juniors to follow the 1-hour rule \u2014 if you stuck on something, spend no more than an hour figuring it out. After that time, approach one of your teammates for help. Not after 5 minutes, not after two days. After 1 hour.",
        "There are many reasons why a company hires junior software engineers, and it is very unlikely that a limited budget is the main one. I wrote a separate article about why it matters to have junior software engineers onboard.",
        "medium.com",
        "One of your roles, junior engineer, is to stretch the flexibility of a technical stack behind our product. Day by day, you will be responsible for \u201cstandard\u201d tasks, like everyone else (product, tech stack, maintenance, testing), but in the long term, the results of your work will tell us what part of our system should be simplified, automated or fixed. We will learn how hard it was for you to make things done or how easy it was to break something. So what my expectations for you here? You should communicate your feedback freely and often. You cannot be afraid to say that there is something you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t understand. Good feedback is also warmly welcomed \u2014 don\u2019t keep it for yourself if something was easy and obvious for you. Someone worked hard to make it that way.",
        "To sum it up \u2014 what are soft skills I will require from you, junior software engineer? Self-motivation, teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and flexibility. With these, we will do our best to help you grow to mid-level software engineer within one year. And yes, hard, technical skills are also very important, but you already have them if you are hired. More will come with the journey.",

Attempting to force objectivity through rigid adherence to a fine-grained rubric is dehumanizing and will likely lead to box-ticking behavior and losing sight of the actual business goals.

        "Junior engineers bring a lot of raw energy and potential to a company. They \u201cdo work\u201d you give them \u2014 often, quite a lot of it. They need help with up-front project planning and the breakdown of tasks into specific chunks of work. Team leads should check in fairly often to make sure they\u2019re on-track and have direction.",
        "I prefer to use the public title \u201cSoftware Engineer\u201d (dropping the \u201cJunior\u201d) because nobody wants to called \u201cjunior.\u201d Internally, you can call this level-1 without insult.",
        "I find level-1 interviews to be the hardest to arrange because candidate skills levels are all over the place. Initiative and critical thinking are what matter most, but these are difficult characteristics to measure in an hour or two. Let go of level-1 engineers who won\u2019t be promoted to level-2 within 2 years.",
        "Level-2 engineers can take ownership over a body of significant software. You can trust them to take loosely defined requests and do the right thing \u2014 break down complex tasks, make reasonable decisions, and operate fairly independently between periodic check-ins. Communication and critical thinking skills are essential.",
        "Should this be called a \u201cSoftware Engineer\u201d or \u201cSenior Software Engineer\u201d? I\u2019m on the fence, but lean towards using the same external title \u201cSenior Software Engineer\u201d for both level-2 or level-3 engineers on business cards and LinkedIn, while internally referring to them by level.",
        "While someone can be a level-2 engineer for several years, eventually they should demonstrate they can take on more ownership and be promoted to level-3, or leave the organization.",
        "Level-3 engineers take ownership over a whole product (e.g. an entire application, or suite of services). In additional to delivering solid and maintainable software, they understand company dynamics and good process.",
        "Senior engineers often wear an additional \u201ctech lead\u201d hat. This means they take on the (thankless) work of project management and process oversight. They keep the trains running on time. Note that a tech lead does not have direct reports and does not boss people around; they lead by gravitas.",
        "This can be a career position. It\u2019s perfectly normal to have solid level-3 engineers who are happy being individual contributors, and don\u2019t want to move to management or general architecture.",
        "Level-4 engineers are architects who can evaluate system-wide platform decisions and set long-term company-wide technical strategy. They often have two roles, working both as individual contributors on a feature team and also as architectural reviewers working with the CTO. Your architects should be humble and outgoing; they are your engineering cheerleaders.",
        "Of course, you should compare this job ladder with the many other excellent blog posts and ladders out there. Here\u2019s a few:",
        "Some areas you\u2019ll see differences of opinion are:",
        "I\u2019d say by the time you have 5\u201310 software engineers and are starting to think about asking someone to become a full-time manager, you should also start thinking about clarifying job roles and career paths.",
        "It\u2019s hard for a committee to write a good job ladder from scratch. I suggest that one engineering manager writes a draft and brings it to the engineering management team to kick off discussion and workshopping. Another approach is to ask all engineering manager to write separate drafts independently, and then meet to compare notes and then merge by committee.",
        "Even if someone sincerely tells you \u201ctitles don\u2019t matter,\u201d all that really means is that \u201ctitles don\u2019t matter at this point in time.\u201d As companies grow, job leveling is inevitable; title will be used as a proxy for level, which dictates your salary and career options. When you switch jobs, you will be recruited and compensated based on your previous title.",
        "Always make sure your title and role are spelled out.",
        "Manage salaries as if you had to post them outside your office door. \u2014 M. W. Mantle, Managing the Unmanageable (2013)",
        "Employers should establish a salary band for each job level, based on industry comparable data. This does restrict their ability to recruit star candidates on the basis of salary, or to reward stellar performers with a big raise; but it\u2019s the only tried-and-true way to keep budgets under control and avoid unfairness.",
        "One-off equity grants with a future vesting cliff, e.g. a grant over 2 years that starts vesting in one year, are one way to reward extraordinary performance. This shows key employees that even though you may not be able to give them a big raise, you still value their contribution and want them to stick around for the long term.",
        "Promotions are generally not rewards for past performance. Instead, management uses promotions to advance those who display the potential to tackle the next level of bigger, tougher problems.  \u2014 Ray Weiss, The Technical Career Navigator (Prentice Hall, 1994)",
        "Promote people who are already functioning at the next level. If a level-2 engineer wants a promotion, they should demonstrate they are doing level-3 work. It\u2019s your job as a manager to give them projects where they can cut their teeth (and land gracefully if they\u2019re not quite ready).",
        "Never create the expectation that promotions are a function of time at the company, or open the door to promoting someone above their ability.",
        "For level 1\u20133 engineers, I haven\u2019t found formal education to be a reliable predictor of success. I\u2019ve had several excellent hires who were self-taught, or who came from vocational 6-month code academies. I no longer require candidates to have undergraduate C.S. degree, and I\u2019ve stopped asking algorithm-heavy interview questions.",
        "The level 4 (principal) engineering role is the exception; the role requires a solid academic foundation in algorithms, systems, architecture and bits-and-bytes.",
        "No; they\u2019re hired guns. Your assessment isn\u2019t about their level, but whether they\u2019ll finish a particular project.",
        "Again, they\u2019re not really on the job ladder because you\u2019re not hiring them full-time. Here\u2019s my rules on interns:",
        "Employees want to know where they stand in an organization. Having well-defined career milestones with expectations and objectives makes everyone\u2019s jobs easier.",
        "When writing a job ladder, the key things are:",
        "You can fine-tune your roles and values over time; but never violate the principle of fairness. Everyone must be held to consistent standards or else your morale and productivity will crumble. A good jobs ladder levels the playing field and lays out the rules to the game.",

Back then the concept of a ladder, the act of spelling out what the requirements and\nexpectations for a specific role and position are, was pretty new to me. Still it immediately appealed to me.",

Forget about titles like \"senior\" and what that means.

There will be aspects of maintainability and clarity which simply aren't a big concern in your solo projects but make a big difference when you have dozens or more developers working on the same code. Communication with coworkers becomes an important skill, collaborative project management etc. These are things which you can't just study and learn on your own, you ramp up on them over the course of working in that kind of environment.

Sending PRs for the first 6 months or so was excruciating for me. I would just sit there and wait to hear him call me over to his desk and begin asking questions about what the fuck my code is doing. But he kept at it, and by the end of the first year, I finally felt like I knew what I was doing. I still had a ton of doubts in my abilities, but I wasn't embarrassed about having my code reviewed. I stayed at the company for 3 years and afterwards jumped to a major tech company.Up until that job, I generally worked by myself and never received much input from others.

We couldn't even write code like that if we tried for, e.g., an April Fool's joke. There's just way too much commitment to doing things dreadfully for it to be possible to be a joke. 1-3 character variable names, huge blocks of code copy/pasted, redundant hard-coded constants, bizarre abuse of scope, resistance to using functions and classes to split up code, god-classes and 5000-line functions when they do get used, etc etc.And I never felt like their main issue was that they're \"bad engineers\" or \"too old\" or anything. It was that they were:1. completely unapologetic\n2. showed absolutely no interest in changing\n3. extremely resistant to any process changes that would hold them accountable for code quality (like doing code reviews or using a linter or CI build process)I think they'd mainly gotten away with just writing crap code for so long that they didn't want to have to change, or had internalized it as \"I just write the code plainly, without using tons of layers of functions and classes and stuff\". And don't mistake this as someone being woke in a herd of people building big towering oop abstraction factories. That job never got anywhere close to having too much abstraction in the code.

This is how I went from basically you\u2019re at now... to being one of those mentors for others. I learned to drop my ego, to embrace rigor I\u2019d previously considered onerous, and to be transparent when I had room for improvement.I\u2019d also recommend spending some time learning something far outside your comfort zone. For me, this was learning functional programming (Clojure) and working on distributed systems in that environment (previously I\u2019d been primarily a frontend dev).Getting involved with an open source project is also a great way to get exposure to both the talent and learning opportunities I discussed.Lastly, I\u2019d recommend pushing yourself to embrace some rigor yourself and see how it improves your work experience. If you don\u2019t do TDD (as in real Red->Green->Refactor), try it out. If you\u2019re not comfortable with a debugger, find one that works well with your toolchain (or try new tools that provide a good debugging experience). If you\u2019re not accustomed to a consistent peer review process, ask a friend/colleague to review your work whenever possible.Some or all of that may sound daunting. And again if you\u2019re more interested in changing track, that\u2019s okay too. But if you do want to become a better developer, these things are not as tough as they sound, and future you will thank present you for the effort.Oh, actually one more thing:> I'm thinking about looking for semi senior roles but I'm afraid it'll look weird for the company interviewing me to hire a semi senior with +10 years of experience.I recently left a job, and asked some friends/former coworkers for recommendations. One that came up was for a less senior role than my previous roles over the last several years. At first I was hesitant, and had similar thoughts to those you expressed here. But I did consider the role anyway, because it would also leave more room for compensation advancement without moving into management. If you\u2019re concerned about this sort of judgment (and if you\u2019re concerned about ageism), feel free to just leave some older experience off your resume.

        "Lastly, I\u2019d recommend pushing yourself to embrace some rigor yourself and see how it improves your work experience. If you don\u2019t do TDD (as in real Red->Green->Refactor), try it out. If you\u2019re not comfortable with a debugger, find one that works well with your toolchain (or try new tools that provide a good debugging experience). If you\u2019re not accustomed to a consistent peer review process, ask a friend/colleague to review your work whenever possible.Some or all of that may sound daunting. And again if you\u2019re more interested in changing track, that\u2019s okay too. But if you do want to become a better developer, these things are not as tough as they sound, and future you will thank present you for the effort.Oh, actually one more thing:> I'm thinking about looking for semi senior roles but I'm afraid it'll look weird for the company interviewing me to hire a semi senior with +10 years of experience.I recently left a job, and asked some friends/former coworkers for recommendations.

        "I've always maintained that you really learn how to write code for a particular problem when you've done it three times. The first is usually to get working code, the second is to redesign it to improve some aspect (adding features, improving performance, code maintainability, etc.), and the third is when you really get it \"right\". Using this approach, it takes time and deliberate practice (borrowing the term from Geoff Colvin's \"Talent is Overrated\").From my point of view, the core question that you're asking is \"How do I get deliberate practice with coding?\" There is no easy answer for this, but here are some ways to break things down so that you can come up with a plan for yourself.1) \"Clean Code\"This was brought up in another comment, but the book does an excellent job of covering many of the techniques for keeping a code base in good shape over time.What can be trickier is 1) there are a lot of techniques, and 2) you may have a hard time taking the techniques from the book and applying them to your situation. While the examples in the book are universal, I think it's easy to get lost applying the technique to a more complex problem.2) Applying One Technique to a Known SituationEither start with a smaller piece of code or a medium piece of code that you know really well. Ideally, use some advanced piece of source code control that allows multiple branches. Then, start doing the practices from \"Clean Code\" one a time with a goal in mind, such as eliminated duplicated code, limiting scope, making functions more configurable via parameters, etc.The real trick? Just do one of these improvement areas at a time. Do it a few times in different parts of the code. Eventually, the patterns start to emerge as to why it improves and where else it can be applied.3) Recognizing PatternsYou may or may not have read articles/books about API design, coding style guidelines, etc. While many of those rules may seem arbitrary, as you get more practice, you'll start to see why such guidelines exist.There will be similar patterns for how your code refactoring can improve modularity, debuggability, development time, testing, error handling, etc. Each code change may not improve all those things simultaneously, but you'll eventually start making improvements that cover more than one area of improvement.4) Improving Your Learning AccelerationThere's a point you'll reach where you can keep refactoring, but you may not learn much more. At that point, try adding a feature. It can be a minor feature or a major one, but you'll start to see where the new feature forces your code to be refactored again. You can write a bunch of code or you can go through the \"what do I need to change in the existing code base to add feature X?\" as a mental exercise. In either case, you'll start to see what prior decisions may not have worked since they only considered one aspect of code improvement instead of three or four.5) Putting All of the Above into ContextAnother aspect of being a \"Senior\" engineer means that you recognize the problems really being solved by your software and what value it has. As you get more senior, you can answer all sorts of questions such as:- How does the customer use this software? What pieces do they pay for? What features save them the most time/money/suffering?\n- What should the next features be?\n- What parts can be improved? Speed? Usability? Data Input? Connectivity/compatibility with other software?\n- What sort of documentation does the user need?\n- Is this software getting dated? What parts need replacing? Does there need to be a new solution (rewrite vs. continued refactoring)?Not all of the above questions are applicable (e.g. tools used inside a company vs. a tool customers buy and use on their own computers), but being able to put the software usage into context (sort of the PM area you were talking about) and breaking down the technical context (the \"senior\" engineer role) are both useful skills.You may need to go back and forth a bit between coding and reading books like \"Clean Code\" before the lessons really get internalized. Using the above guidelines and knowing what sort of learning process works best for yourself, hopefully you can start taking steps to improving in ways that help your career.",

Eventually, the patterns start to emerge as to why it improves and where else it can be applied.3) Recognizing PatternsYou may or may not have read articles/books about API design, coding style guidelines, etc. While many of those rules may seem arbitrary, as you get more practice, you'll start to see why such guidelines exist.There will be similar patterns for how your code refactoring can improve modularity, debuggability, development time, testing, error handling, etc. Each code change may not improve all those things simultaneously, but you'll eventually start making improvements that cover more than one area of improvement.4) Improving Your Learning AccelerationThere's a point you'll reach where you can keep refactoring, but you may not learn much more. At that point, try adding a feature. It can be a minor feature or a major one, but you'll start to see where the new feature forces your code to be refactored again. You can write a bunch of code or you can go through the \"what do I need to change in the existing code base to add feature X?\" as a mental exercise.

Connectivity/compatibility with other software?\n- What sort of documentation does the user need?\n- Is this software getting dated? What parts need replacing? Does there need to be a new solution (rewrite vs. continued refactoring)?Not all of the above questions are applicable (e.g. tools used inside a company vs. a tool customers buy and use on their own computers), but being able to put the software usage into context (sort of the PM area you were talking about) and breaking down the technical context (the \"senior\" engineer role) are both useful skills.You may need to go back and forth a bit between coding and reading books like \"Clean Code\" before the lessons really get internalized.

        "I had an engineer on my team that was struggling. For some projects that should take a single day to do, he would take almost two weeks. We started pairing him up with other engineers to teach him, and he was able to work with them effectively, but his solo productivity and his code quality on his own never really increased.I considered putting him on a PIP and then letting him go, but while I was considering that, there was an incident, and the whole team jumped on a Zoom to handle the incident. Maybe it was because I was thinking of him specifically, but I could tell that he was thriving in this environment. He was identifying the bugs quickly, he was pinging the right people, he pulled up the right graphs and metrics immediately. It was honestly really impressive.So I spoke with our head of Site Reliability and asked if he had an open role. He did. And he agreed that this guy was doing a good job and that he would take him on.This engineer is now one of the most productive SREs in our organization. He writes a lot less code, but he's a lot more involved in adrenaline-pumping incidents. He's a great people person, so he knows everyone, and everyone knows him. When an incident pops up and people get paged, he communicates it clearly.This is nothing less than a huge success story. I didn't lose anything by losing an underperforming engineer, but I gained a stellar SRE.All of this is to say... maybe there are other roles in the company that would be a better fit for you. Maybe you would thrive in a DevOps role focusing less on code and more on infrastructure, or maybe in a SRE role that is about building redundancies and safety nets for the organization. Maybe you'd  absolutely kill it as a PM. (Contrary to what you said, most PMs I know are not technical, so having any level of technical expertise is a huge plus. If you have lots of product ideas and like doing research, this might be a winner for you.)If you trust your boss (and I hope you do), it would be worth talking to them and getting their perspective. Phrase it in a positive way, not in a self-deprecating way. Something along the lines of \"I'm thinking about my long-term career, and I'm not sure I see myself as a Principal Engineer someday. What skill sets do you think I excel in? Do you think you can help me find opportunities to level up those skills and maybe find a role where I can utilize them the best?\" Something like that.Finally, I forget who said it, but someone said that you should work on improving your strengths, not your weaknesses. In other words, you don't see Michael Phelps running marathons or Usain Bolt swimming across the English Channel. Phelps swims and Bolt runs... because they're good at those things! And because they keep focusing on their strongest skill set, they get better and better. Just a thought.Good luck!",

        "1. Age does not play a factor2. Resume progression looks cool but practically means nothing. I have hired engineers that have been demoted (maybe adversity yields character.) I'm determining if you can pass my interview, not the last person's.3. Software Engineers go in and out of relevancy all the time, the only difference is that you're noticing it during interviewing.Now, as a drop out, I had to learn things on my own. I'll go over what I expect out of a Senior engineer. Keep in mind I work on a team where algorithms and data structures do matter, not all teams are like this. So, think about what you want your next team to be about.1. Have knowledge of how algorithms work and what data structures work best with them. This is useful when dealing with tasks that must scale incredible loads.2. Asymptotics. I generally only ask Big O questions, but know what the others are too. Big O is either memorization or a deep understanding, either is fine for Senior. You would need to be able to answer time and space complexity questions in my interview, in the form of, \"walk me through the time complexity of what we just did.\" Sometimes I'll ask about space complexity but only if I see that you allocated memory for reasons I don't understand.3. Abstract Systems Design is my love-child. Be inventive and take calculated risks. I don't expect you to be perfect, but I do expect a data-informed plan.4. \"Clean code\" is a hyped term but it will communicate something about you. Use clearly defined interfaces and keep your concerns/domains separated in code. I'll explain a bit more below.5. Learn to write tests with definitive outcomes. Usually when I'm helping a SWE with a problem and I'm short on time it's easier to crank out some tests that will keep them within my expectations rather than hold their hand the whole way through.The whole \"clean code\" thing is iffy, imo. I learned to write good looking code by attaching linters, formatters, and static analysis tools to my IDE and learning through repetition. Designing good applications was harder, but it dawned on me when I had to write multi-threaded applications or applications that implement concurrency. You will start to naturally separate your code if you start doing this.Learning asymptotics was iterative for me. Start on one of the Big O cheat sheet pages then Google each data structure/operation to understand why it works out the way it does.There are lots of tutorials for learning to identify algorithms and data structures. This will be time consuming, but it can also yield benefits in your work depending on what you decide to do next.I hope this helps!",

        "Hi all, I'm needing some advice about my current situation. I recently graduated as a CS major and I got converted into full time at a rather well-known tech company. My internship with them was in a dev role, developing new features, and my manager at the time gave me good reviews. I got signed on as a Software Engineer, as clearly stated in the offer letter, but has not been assigned a team at that time. Team has only been assigned recently and when I got assigned a team, I tried to ask for more info but didn't get anything back, but I have had my suspicion that it is a DevOps role (or they call it Site Reliability Engineering but its basically DevOps).",
        "An email today confirms it, half a week before my start date. I'm trying to ask if I can possibly change team but I'm really just lost, it's not what I expected at all, and I'm not remotely sure if I'm ready for this, not in the sense of learning new things since I don't mind that at all but having a new lifestyle that revolves around on-calls and not being able to get SWE experience. I will acknowledge too that maybe some will find my rant entitled since there a lot of Americans without jobs right now, and I'm an international student complaining, but I honestly feel very trapped at this moment since this is not what I study for, not what I expect during negotiation and signing, not how I expect my work life to be (since DevOps have very high off-the-clock commitment), and this is not a career path that I want to pursue long terms, all of this only known half a week before the start date so I hope you can understand.",
        "I have a few questions for you all:",
        "+ Is this a normal thing, or at least not an unheard of thing, to be assigned a DevOps role after you have signed on as a software engineer? Has anyone experienced this before and how did you respond to this situation?",
        "+ Is this going to affect my long-term career if I want to go into SWE roles in the future?",
        "+ How should I approach this situation if I want to switch team before start? I have already sent an email to HR but got no response so far. If it would not work, how can I approach switching teams later on down the line?",
        "+ If I have to end up going into this role, how should I approach it and how should I spend my time if I want to go to a dev role later on? Any advice for going into devops as a new grad?",
        "Edit: Thank you every for their responses so far. Just to clarify, I understand that there's a difference between SRE and DevOps, and SRE if done the Google way can have a lot of coding. However, from what I was given, the duties listed are:",
        "+ I will be working along with the product dev team (but not in it) and other SREs",
        "+ I will have 24/7 on-call rotation responding to outages",

During career fairs in the US, all participating companies get to set up their booths. Candidates visit companies of their interest, share their resume with them, and discuss the position they are looking for. It is not uncommon to stand in a 30 to 45 minutes long queue for firms like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.",
        "To make the most out of a career fair, you should know how to work a career fair efficiently.",
        "Not all the companies of your interest are going to visit career fair events at your college. You have to apply to a lot of them off-campus as well. A general trend that I observed is, \u201cthe number of students getting an internship by off-campus application is way higher than the number of students getting it through career fairs.\u201d",

        "How long to wait for a referral?",
        "There is no magic formula for this, but you must have this number for each company you are applying to. The closing date for a job might not be mentioned in the listing. I learned this the hard way when a few job postings got closed while I was waiting for a successful referral. Some pointers which might be helpful here are: 1) How old is the job posting? If it is very old, it might be better to go ahead and apply without a referral; 2) Check out the same job posting on other platforms and the companies careers page itself, in case one of them has an end date.",
        "3. It is a Continuous Process",
        "Off-campus application is not a one-shot process. It is rather continuous and iterative, typically having a 5-day timeline.",

        "5. Keep Track",
        "It is impossible to keep a mental map of companies you want to apply to, companies you have already applied to, which stage are you with an already applied company, etc. Take the help of online tools like Google Sheets. Below is my sample tracker with some drastic color combinations which luckily worked for me. Come up with what works best for you, or feel free to use my tracker. I used Sort Range Plus add-on to sort rows as per their color.",
        "6. LinkedIn Premium",
        "One fine day, you may hit the upper cap on LinkedIn\u2019s searches for unpaid user accounts. This was a dead-end for me and I purchased LinkedIn Premium at this point. If you find another solution, do share it with me. From my own experience, I found LinkedIn Premium to be very useful with unlimited searches and some other extra features. P.S.: You also will apply more once you have paid for LinkedIn Premium :P",
        "By now, we have a solid grip on how to apply for interviews. Let us now look at how to prepare for them.",
        "As a Computer Science student, most of your interviews are going to be technical ones, assessing your coding abilities. Leetcode is one of the most useful platforms for technical interview preparation in the US. A lot of companies even mention using Leetcode while preparing for their interviews.",
        "While you can access all the questions using a free Leetcode account, a premium account lets you filter questions by companies and frequency. This is very helpful in company-specific interview preparation, or in general to practice most frequently asked questions, etc. Having used a premium account myself, I found it to be worth investing in.",
        "During interviews, you would be writing code on paper, whiteboard (face to face interviews), Google Docs, Codeshare, etc. (telephonic interviews). Thus, it is important to practice writing code without relying on an IDE. Leetcode editor does a great job for this and you should be good to go if you are practicing on Leetcode.",
        "Most colleges conduct mock interview sessions and you should attend at least one of them before you go through an actual interview. They allow you to practice and improve your interviewing techniques and answers. You can also conduct mock interviews within your circle if that works for you.",
        "The basic premise behind behavioral interviews is that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. A sample question for this round can be, \u201cTell me about a team experience in which one member did not meet expectations.\u201d It might be very difficult to tackle such questions on the spot, without any prior preparation. In responding to such questions, it is best to provide a specific example to support your response. I would let readers explore the internet to know more about behavioral interviews.",
        "The best of us have missed interviews, or scheduled overlapping interviews. Use tools like Google Calendar to log all your interviews, and refer to it while scheduling new ones. Also, keep in mind there are multiple time zones in the US and check the timezone properly in an interview request.",

It also calculates cost of living based on the cost of living downtown so it ignores that one could save money by living further out. Furthermore, it does not account for culture, equity compensation, bonuses, the availability of jobs within the city itself, and the difficulty of immigration. The absence of equity compensation can be especially galling as it can make up a significant portion of one's total compensation. Unfortunately, finding data on that that covers a wide range of companies rather than the usual FAANG crop can be difficult so that had to be left out of the analysis.

This is not a perfect means of capturing the average salary of software developers as it is possible that folks are posting their salaries under titles such as Back-end Developer or something else but doing it this way offers a reasonable proxy. These salaries are in USD and as mentioned earlier, they do not account for equity, taxes, and bonuses. Again, as stated earlier, while equity and bonuses are often a substantial part of compensation, it is difficult to find this data across a wide range of jurisdictions and companies so I was forced to ignore it for the purposes of this analysis. With regard to the reasoning behind choosing average salary over median salary, I chose the average salary because that is what Glassdoor gives. I wasn't particularly picky about my data for my very superficial analysis :).",
        "From the chart above, we see that the usual hearsay about software developer salaries seem to be validated as American salaries tend to be higher than Canadian and European salaries with San Francisco exceeding everyone else. The only surprising result (at least to me) from this chart would be that the average salary in Zurich seems to be comparable to San Francisco.",
        "When considering cost of living, nothing surprising pops out. San Francisco and New York City top the list with other well-known cities such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Seattle trailing them. However, considering the absolute cost of living isn't particularly useful as the income one makes within that city might make living there worth the cost. Hence, it is useful to take a look at the percentage of one's salary that cost of living can take up. With regard to the methodology here, the rent for a 1 bedroom apartment and the average cost of living for 1 person (excluding rent) were taken from Numbeo and summed. The resulting sum was then converted to USD to get the numbers before you.",
        "From these percentages, we can see that Toronto and Vancouver have a cost of living that is surprisingly similar to San Francisco and New York City once we adjust for incomes which explains much of the dissatisfaction surrounding Canadian tech salaries that I personally have seen.",
        "From taking a look at the average tax rates across all of the jurisdictions for the specific salaries mentioned earlier, we obtain the surprising result that tax rates tend to be fairly even across all of them for the average software engineer with the notable outliers being Amsterdam and Copenhagen. To further explain the calculation, what I did was take the average salary for each city and plug it into Neuvoo for the relevant jurisdiction (ex. Toronto's salary from the previous section is taxed at an estimate based on Ontario's tax laws that accounts for federal and provincial taxes).",
        "The cornerstone of this analysis is net incomes. From deducting taxes and cost of living, we can see how much money in USD the average software developer is likely to have. From looking at the absolute values, we see that Zurich and Seattle are clearly the top performers in this analysis. When we look at percentages, we see that Kitchener, Austin, and Berlin are top performers. I suspect for most folks, the absolute values are significantly more useful than the percentages but I find the percentages interesting nonetheless.",

We get to know the players and the teams very well and are very close to the game. My group is small and tight-knit, and we all share a deep love for the game and this league.",
        "In the social media age, digital photography is all about quickness. The NBA Photo department supplies photos for all NBA teams to the outside world. It\u2019s important for us to keep up with the latest technology so the images that represent the excitement of our game can be accessed and distributed in almost real time",
        "In my role, I have a window into the many different roles and responsibilities at the NBA. I work very closely with our marketing partners and collaborate with many different internal groups to bring those partnerships to life. My colleagues are incredibly skilled and talented, and I think that is what makes working at the NBA so great.",
        "My professional story highlights the NBA\u2019s willingness to support the development of its employees. I started off at the NBA Store as a Sales Associate. After about one year selling swingman jerseys and NBA-branded socks, I transitioned to the corporate office to support the talent acquisition team. Fast forward to today, I am part of the basketball recruiting team within talent acquisition, where we support basketball-related departments with full life-cycle recruiting, operations, and strategic initiatives.",
        "The NBA is uniquely diverse from a cultural and social perspective, as well as in the range of expertise that supports the league. My background is in complex construction project management. The NBA\u2019s commitment to career development has provided me\u2014and many colleagues throughout the league\u2014the opportunity to develop workspaces and arenas that are amongst the most innovative facilities in the world.",
        "There is simply no better place to work if you have a passion for the game of basketball and seek an environment that empowers and inspires. Every day is unique and every season is special. We all have the ability to make our mark on the legacy of the game in small ways and big ways. I\u2019ve had opportunities to connect with our world class teams, engage with global brands and even work with some of the game\u2019s greatest players.",
        "I worked in print media early in my career. As the media landscape began shifting to digital, I wanted to be part of a leader in the space. I joined the NBA because I knew it would be the best place to learn, grow and shape some of the most influential digital products in the world.",
        "I started at the NBA in the summer of 2010 as a Creative Services intern and was hired in 2012. The NBA Internship Program was a great opportunity for me to learn about broadcast graphics design and helped me gain the experience I needed to come back and work as a project employee during my college breaks. I was hired as a Motion Graphics Designer after graduating from college.",

We build and integrate systems that enable us to deliver live game clips to social media, highlight packages to partners and full length features. The unique thing about my role is that I have a technical background but I get to apply it to the game of basketball. It is a rare experience to be behind the scenes to see how technology is used in all aspects of the game.",
        "My favorite part of working at the NBA is the people. My colleagues are very talented and driven, but know how to keep things fun. In Broadcast Operations & Engineering, I am constantly challenged with new projects, which enables me to consistently learn and grow. The NBA remains on the leading edge of technology, which keeps me engaged and excited about my job.",

You understand the game plan and, most importantly, you understand the team.",

The people I have met and learned from while working at the NBA have been invaluable to developing my career. The league continues to present new opportunities.",
        "I always had an interest in television production and sports. While I was in college, I had the opportunity to intern in the Multimedia group for the Detroit Pistons, which introduced me to NBA Entertainment. I was amazed at the content that was being produced and wanted to be a part of it.",
        "I worked for a corporate law firm prior to joining the NBA and had no previous experience in sports. But the NBA saw that I had the right skills and experience for the job. I really appreciate that the recruiting team looks at the whole person rather than just searching a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a few key words.",
        "My primary responsibility on the Global Partner Management team is to liaise with our global partners and league departments such as Media, Content and Communications. A typical day includes working with a partner to bring their marketing initiatives to life, as well as exploring new marketing and media opportunities that could enhance and grow the partnership. I work with a ton of great people, both internally and externally.",
        "As a lawyer at the NBA, I regularly work on cutting-edge legal issues. While my substantive responsibilities are both intellectually stimulating and challenging, the best part of my job is working with my colleagues. Whether in the Legal Department or other groups at the NBA, I find that our team is filled with smart people who are all focused on growing the game and genuinely enjoy working with each other.",
        "I began my NBA career as a summer intern during college, and I\u2019ve been here ever since. At the NBA, we are encouraged to think differently and find new ways of doing things. Someone is always listening for the next great idea. I\u2019ve always felt this is the kind of place where you can go as far as you\u2019d like to take it.",
        "My colleagues and I work on legal agreements and other arrangements that cover a wide range of business opportunities for the NBA, including anything from a new digital platform to an innovative international venture. The multitude of new opportunities and challenges that I see every day not only keep my job fresh, but also allow me to grow my career.",
        "If I asked my 18 year-old self where I thought I would be at 26, I never would have imagined where I am today. Not only has the NBA given me a \u201cjob\u201d but it has provided me with exciting opportunities and a lifelong career path. My job description varies from day to day. I can sit in the office processing invoices or I can be on the road organizing a production shoot. What I love most is how I can show my many different skills on multiple platforms.",

        "The formlabs resign cartridge pretty much has no encryption. It uses a one wire Maxim DS2431 EPPROM as a place to store information about the cartridge (type, ml used, etc). The data itself is encrypted and there seeems to be a checksum against the chip\u2019s registration number so you can\u2019t just write data from one chip to another.",
        "However\u2026 one wire protocol is simple and easy to emulate, there is actually a arduino library out there to emulate one wire devices: https://github.com/orgua/OneWireHub and DS2431 is already fully implemented and tested.

When a cartridge is loaded, the contents of the EEPROM is read and decrypted in the printer and the chip/internal table updated periodically.  When a cartridge is first loaded that uses the old data spec, the printer converts it to the new spec and immediately writes the updated data back to eeprom then verifies it with an immediate read.",

Oh, and since the new cartridges manufactured from that point forward utilize the fully encrypted spec, you are basically on a countdown timer until your \u201cunstoppable\u201d hack gets scrapped, perhaps at something like the resin shelf life cycle + 25% or so for good measure, thus killing your hack even if you do decide to go the route of spoofing the device IDs.",
        "My point here is that the hubris of going on a manufacturer forum and telling folks that you have a plan for an unblockable hack while bashing someone for playing it (wisely) close to the vest is uncalled for and arrogant.  All it serves to do is further motivate Formlabs to squash such efforts.  The comparison of this to an old game console is about useless.  Those platforms had no way to WRITE to the cartridges.  The onewire device here is nothing more than a storage medium, so its not about the device at all in this case, its about managing the data format that is stored on it, and that is something Formlabs can most certainly change on the fly, so long as they maintain backwards compatibility for just long enough to allow previous generation cartridges to phase out.",

        "Why leading companies merge recruitment and internal mobility strategies to build stronger workforces while reducing costs and improving retention rates.",
        "Smart companies are merging recruitment and internal mobility because they create a holistic talent strategy that reduces costs, improves retention, and builds a stronger workforce. This integration leverages internal talent, boomerang employees, and external recruitment to create a seamless talent ecosystem.",
        "",
        "",
        "Many talent acquisition (TA) departments face a conundrum. To fill critical vacancies, is it better to nurture homegrown talent, engage retirees, alums, and part-time leavers, or explore external talent pools? Smart companies understand the importance of integrating talent acquisition, employee retention, and internal mobility to build a more comprehensive approach to workforce management. When companies combine these functions, they better understand their total talent landscape.",
        "",
        "Mobility within a company involves identifying, developing, and deploying internal talent across different organizational roles or departments. Once considered a separate function from external recruitment, mobility is now seen as a critical component of a unified talent strategy.",
        "\u201cBack to the company,\u201d or boomerang mobility, involves someone who leaves an organization and later returns to the same company. This could happen after pursuing another job, furthering education, or exploring personal goals. Boomerang employees often rejoin the company in the same or a different role, bringing back their previous experience along with new skills or perspectives gained during their time away. Benefits include faster onboarding, proven cultural fit, and established relationships.\u00a0When aligned \u201cinto the company,\u201d external recruitment, boomerang, and internal mobility create a seamless talent ecosystem. External and boomerang recruitment bring fresh perspectives and expertise, while internal mobility ensures existing employees are continually engaged and upskilled. Together, they build a resilient workforce capable of adapting to change.",
        "",
        "There are several reasons for businesses to integrate the various types of mobility. Some of these include:",
        "Forbes estimates the cost of recruiting a \u201cmid-career software engineer\u201d to be roughly $30,000. By contrast, an organization may spend approximately $20,000 less to train and upskill an existing employee. When accounting for potential salary and recruiting savings, an organization could save up to $116,000 per engineer over a three-year period.",
        "Hiring professionals can also leverage this integrated model to improve retention rates. In the aftermath of the Great Resignation, Pew Research Center surveyed workers who quit during the mass 2021 exodus. Participants were asked to cite reasons why they left and categorize those motivators as \u201cmajor reasons\u201d or \u201cminor reasons.\u201d Sixty-three percent of participants cited \u201cno opportunities for advancement\u201d as a minor cause and 33% considered it a major reason. Employees will leave if they don\u2019t have the opportunity to advance their careers.",
        "Internal mobility reduces the time it takes to fill roles by allowing businesses to access a pool of qualified in-house talent. These candidates already understand company culture and processes, leading to higher success rates in new roles. Our partner, Paradox AI, uses conversational software to engage candidates 24/7, helping companies reduce hard-to-fill roles by up to 80%.",
        "Quality candidates are attracted to companies that demonstrate investment in employee development and internal career progression.

Companies like The Muse provide professional, branded content development services, helping you highlight your unique culture and values to connect with next-generation talent.",

        "Data driven market intelligence tracks the price of attracting talent through paid advertising.",
        "Dedicated to making hiring better for everyone.",
        "Discover how candidate assessment can help employer reduce the time-to-hire and find the right top talent.",
        "Competition for talented employees remains strong in the current hiring market. In June, the unemployment rate was just 3.6%, while employers added over 200K jobs to American payrolls. To attract the most qualified workers, companies are offering higher wages. In fact, salaries are up 4.4% from last year.",
        "While there may be a war for talent, employers must carefully assess an applicant\u2019s skills and experience to ensure they\u2019re the right person for the role. Interviews can help, but many companies also use candidate assessments to evaluate potential employees.",
        "When implemented into an employer\u2019s hiring processes, candidate assessments help streamline the experience for both applicants and companies. They provide data-driven information that hiring professionals can turn to when they\u2019re on the fence about an applicant.",
        "According to TalentLyft, assessments can decrease the time-to-hire by up to 50%. That\u2019s important because top candidates typically engage with multiple companies when looking for their newest role. If hiring professionals can get them through the pipeline faster than competitors, they are more likely to secure high-quality talent for open positions.",
        "Often, hiring professionals get bogged down in the hundreds of resumes they receive for their open roles. Spending too much time on unqualified candidates hampers the hiring process, and genuinely talented professionals may get lost in the shuffle.",
        "With a candidate assessment test, the most skilled candidates will rise to the top of the list. It takes the guesswork out of resume evaluation and helps to automate the screening process. Hiring professionals can use these results to compare candidates\u2019 skills and cultural fit and make unbiased decisions on who moves forward to the interview stage.",
        "",
        "",
        "A candidate assessment is a testing tool used to evaluate an applicant\u2019s skills, personality, or cognitive strengths. Hiring professionals can select between a broad range of examinations that fit their objectives. Sometimes, employers use a combination of tests for a holistic look at their candidates.",
        "Candidate assessments are excellent predictors of future job performance, especially when evaluating a person\u2019s skills or cultural fit. The overarching objective of the tests is to select the top applicants for a role using an informed decision-making process.",
        "Hiring professionals can administer candidate assessments at any stage of the screening process. Requiring applicants to take tests during the application stage can help recruiters sort qualified candidates from those with lesser abilities and move the top-performing ones on to an interview.",
        "Similarly, tests administered following an interview can help hiring professionals narrow down their top applicants.",
        "",
        "There are multiple advantages to using candidate assessments during the hiring process. First, they can help hiring professionals identify the top candidates in an applicant pool. These companies may overlook the most qualified people because their resumes don\u2019t reflect their skills correctly or other applicants overemphasize their abilities.",
        "By using an assessment, companies can improve the quality of their hires. They\u2019ll instantly know who their top candidates are and move away from those who aren\u2019t a suitable fit for their organization. Quality hires often improve the productivity of an organization since they have the skills and capabilities necessary to perform their roles.",
        "Similarly, a well-placed hire can decrease overall turnover rates in an organization. People who are a great fit for the role they\u2019re asked to perform are less likely to leave the company. They\u2019ll enjoy their tasks and responsibilities and fit in well with the organization\u2019s work culture.",
        "",
        "Candidate assessments can reduce the time-to-hire for an organization. Applicants who perform well on their tests will quickly attract the attention of recruiters, who can move the interview process forward with them. Rather than taking weeks or months to find the right candidate, companies can hire them within days.",
        "Once a company begins including candidate assessment tests in their hiring process, they\u2019ll see an improvement in the organization\u2019s overall talent profile. Usually, those differences become even more pronounced as the company continues to bring on people who perform well on their assessments. The result of integrating these assessments is a more cohesive workforce that shares common values \u2013 one that is better equipped for retention and high performance.",
        "Tip: It\u2019s best to integrate the tests at various points in the hiring process to see the benefits of a candidate evaluation process. Seamless testing provides a better applicant experience and helps mitigate the costs associated with one-off testing.",
        "Hiring the wrong person for an open role can be quite costly. A bad hire can adversely impact workplace productivity, employee morale, and the employer brand. It can also increase training costs and harm the company\u2019s overall profitability.",
        "",
        "Most employers use recruitment assessment tools to evaluate their candidates. These evaluations may appear as part of the initial application for the job to weed out unqualified candidates. They can also be used to better evaluate a candidate\u2019s skill level once a hiring manager determines that they meet minimum qualifications.",
        "The potential employee will receive a link to take the assessment, which they can complete on their own time. Once a candidate completes the testing process, organizations will benchmark their results against industry standards, current employee profiles, and other applicants. They can integrate results into their applicant tracking systems so all stakeholders can review them.",
        "",
        "There are several types of candidate assessments available, including all of the following:",
        "",
        "Skills tests evaluate a candidate\u2019s proficiencies in areas critical to the role. For instance, a company hiring a software engineer might use skills testing to assess their coding abilities.",
        "",
        "A work sample requires the applicant to complete a task relevant to the role and submit it for evaluation. A company looking for a talented writer might ask them to write a paper on the topic of their choice.",
        "",
        "Cognitive tests evaluate an applicant\u2019s critical thinking skills. They help recruiters understand the candidate\u2019s general aptitude and better determine how they might respond to common scenarios on the job.",
        "",
        "",
        "Motivational tests look past a candidate\u2019s abilities to determine what drives them to perform at work. They can help hiring professionals understand the type of work environment the applicant thrives in.",
        "",
        "A personality test measures a candidate\u2019s cultural fit. It can help employers understand how applicants react in different situations and how they communicate or collaborate with others.",
        "Skills-based testing is best for roles that require a high degree of technical proficiency. When filling positions that require employees to collaborate with others, hiring professionals may benefit from using personality or motivation tests.",
        "",
        "While candidate assessments can undoubtedly improve the quality of hires and reduce employee turnover, hiring managers should carefully consider a few things before implementing them.",
        "First, it helps to understand hiring objectives. An assessment isn\u2019t beneficial unless it\u2019s used to evaluate qualities that are desirable in a team. Hiring managers should search for providers that offer the tests best suited for their needs, whether they\u2019re used to assess the candidate\u2019s intelligence and personality or something more specific, like coding ability. For example, a programming evaluation tool could measure code readability and efficiency, while a typing speed test could serve as a preliminary productivity indicator.",
        "The best assessments don\u2019t take hours for an applicant to complete. Ideally, the testing will last less than twenty minutes. If it\u2019s too cumbersome, a candidate may end their application process prematurely, which means the company may miss out on a talented worker. Remember, candidate experience is important to the employer brand, and a negative experience in the hiring process can affect the employer\u2019s image.",
        "Many people submit job applications through mobile devices like smartphones or tablets. If possible, select assessments that are mobile-friendly. That way, candidates can complete them when they\u2019re on the go. They don\u2019t need to be in front of their desktop computer to take the test.",
        "",
        "Some testing providers have limitations on their integrations. Once hiring professionals find a company that provides the necessary tests, they should ensure that those tests can be easily integrated into their applicant tracking system. Proper software integrations ensure that test results appear immediately in a candidate\u2019s hiring profile so recruiters can evaluate them.",
        "Tip: While candidate assessments can tell hiring professionals a lot about their applicants, ensuring that the assessment is fair to all talent is crucial. Tests should be distributed equally among qualified workers, giving all talent the opportunity to demonstrate their unique skills and qualifications.",
        "",
        "Employers who integrate recruitment assessment tools into their application process find it much easier to evaluate applicants, especially when they receive hundreds of resumes for their open roles.",
        "Testing helps employers more effectively assess \u2013 without solely relying on interviews and resumes \u2013\u00a0 which candidates have the skills and disposition required to be successful on the job.",
        "While implementing candidate assessments into the hiring process may take a little effort, the results can pay off tremendously.",

        "Based on reviewing hundreds of resumes per year and researching a book, here are the seven pieces of advice for engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "In an ideal world, you wouldn\u2019t need a resume. You\u2019d have a recruiter reach out to you along the lines of: \u201cYour ex-colleague Bob spoke extremely highly of your time working at Stack Overflow. Our company is growing, and we\u2019d love to talk with you. Do you have time to chat with a few members of the team next Wednesday?\u201d",
        "However, in reality, you will, at some point, find yourself applying at a company where Bob is not there to vouch for you, so you cannot skip through the process of being evaluated before the team will talk to you.",
        "I\u2019ve been a hiring manager for numerous companies and typically go through hundreds of resumes per year. I\u2019ve also researched the topic of writing a developer resume that represents you well while writing the book The Tech Resume Inside Out: What a Good Developer Resume Looks Like. For the book, I ended up talking with two dozen recruiters and hiring managers at the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Transferwise, and other well-known companies.",
        "Based on that experience, here are the seven pieces of advice that I give to engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "Many engineers assume their resume should just contain highlights of their employment history. They\u2019ve seen other people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles and seen a few resumes. Most of these look like this, and companies must be interested in what you did. Right?",
        "Wrong.",
        "The goal of your resume is to sell you enough to get a recruiter phone call and continue the process. This is a very different goal from telling your entire professional story. Your goal should be to showcase to the company why you\u2019re a good fit for the position they are recruiting for.",
        "This means highlighting parts of your resume that show you being a great match for a specific position. Tuning it to fit the opening might be as simple as changing the order of things or adding specific details that only this position might find interesting. When you have lots of experience, this might mean cutting less relevant parts short and leaving irrelevant things off.",
        "Here\u2019s how a typical hiring manager and recruiter will read your resume:",
        "1. Quick scan. They\u2019ll do a short scan of a few seconds, gathering all key information. Your location, years of experience, languages and technologies, position names, company names, and anything else that stands out.",
        "2. Second read. Assuming this first scan matches what they\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll re-read your resume, top to bottom, reading the content you wrote. However, if, in the quick scan, it didn\u2019t seem that you have what the position needs, there will be no second read.",
        "You should choose a resume format that helps highlight the key information the recruiter or hiring manager looks for in that first scan. A good resume template follows these principles:",
        "Why bother spending the time finding a good template? The less effort it is for a recruiter to get the key information in the quick scan, the more time they\u2019ll have to look at other parts of your resume. Here\u2019s a resume template you could use\u2014I created this template for the book, and it satisfies all the above requirements. Of course, there are many others to choose from, and you can also design your own.",
        "The recruiter or hiring manager will read your resume top to bottom. You\u2019ll want the most relevant parts to be at the top and less relevant ones towards the bottom. When you have lots of experience, it\u2019s fine to go beyond just one page: just make sure that everything relevant is still on the first page.",
        "When you\u2019re a new grad or bootcamp grad, hiring managers usually care about experience in this order:",
        "When you have work experience, the way a recruiter reads your resume changes. Here is what will be most relevant:",
        "With lots of work experience, you start to stand out from the crowd of applicants. At the same time, you\u2019ll probably have more experience than would fit on a page or two. In this case, a one-page resume is no longer a must-have, but you\u2019ll want to be more concise in your earlier experience: especially when that experience is not as relevant. Here\u2019s the order you could consider structuring your resume:",
        "It can feel painful to cut away some of your experience from your resume. But keep in mind your goal: it\u2019s to have that recruiter call. I collaborated with a systems administrator turned developer who had 20 years of experience. Ten years ago, they went back to college to get a computer science degree. Their original resume had all 20 years of experience listed: non-CS degree, ten years working as a systems admin, CS degree, ten years as a developer. The first ten years did not add much professionally to their resume: they ended up removing this, but still keeping their first, non-CS degree there. The new resume was cleaner, and they saw more callbacks with it.",
        "While you don\u2019t need to remove old positions, you should aim to reduce detail mentions significantly, except if they would add something very valuable for your current job application.",
        "Keep regional and cultural differences in mind as you craft your resume. For example, in most of the US, a one-page resume is the norm for developers with less than a few years\u2019 experience. Even more senior people aim to fit everything important on the first page. In most of Europe, resumes of two pages are common, and some hiring managers actually prefer to read longer resumes for senior people. Whatever the length, make sure you communicate the relevant parts first. Use the space wisely, elaborating more on your experiences and results that relate to the position you are applying for.",
        "Positions hiring for generalist software engineers will want to see some evidence that you have worked with a few technologies. For these places, it\u2019s a good sign if you\u2019ve mastered multiple technologies. Positions hiring for specific technologies will want to confirm that you did meaningful work with those technologies.",
        "There are a few ways you could make it clear what languages and technologies you are proficient with:",
        "1. Have a separate section for \u201clanguages and technologies\u201d on the first page of your resume.",
        "In this section, list out areas you are proficient with. Don\u2019t bother specifying your expertise level: the hiring manager will assume you know these well enough if you listed them. An example of this approach can look like this:",
        "2. Call out languages and technologies that you used as part of your work experience.",
        "An alternative to the previous approach is to mention the tools you used in each position. This gives more context on when you used these technologies or frameworks and what problems you solved using them. You could just list these out separately at the end of each position like this:",
        "However, I recommend \u201cweaving in\u201d the languages and technologies to the description itself. This both reads better, and you can give even more context:",
        "One thing I wish more resumes had is specifics. The majority of CVs I\u2019ve read tend to list responsibilities, what work was assigned, or have a hand-wavy explanation of the work. Here\u2019s an example of a resume snippet that recruiters and hiring managers see all too commonly:",
        "While the person writing these details probably felt they were showcasing the work they were doing\u2014the hiring manager gets little to no context on the specifics of the work. To stand out, be specific. To be specific, follow this approach:",
        "Having a \u201cmaster\u201d resume and tailoring it for every position you apply for is a great strategy. The tailoring doesn\u2019t have to be drastic. However, if you are applying for a company where the job listing lists the stack as React and Node\u2014and you have experience with these, among other languages\u2014moving these up front could be a small change with a big impact. Similarly, if you\u2019ve done work similar to what the position is asking for, having these bullet points listed first are all good ways to grab the attention of the person reading the resume earlier.",
        "One last thing I need to call out, as developers seeking jobs bring it up: the application tracking systems (ATS), and robots \u201crejecting\u201d your resume. This is false. Your resume will be read by a human. At tech companies, ATSes do not \u201creject\u201d resumes, and \u201crobot rejection\u201d does not exist in tech. Be wary of any resource that claims this is true: they are probably using the tactic to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt as an incentive for you to buy their service. I\u2019m saying this both as a hiring manager who has worked with ATSes and as an author who interviewed recruiters at all major tech companies. I asked them about robot rejections; they all confirmed that they have not seen or heard of such a practice.",
        "Applying for a job does not end with having a good resume. A few things can greatly help your job search: referrals, cover letters, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.",
        "Employee referrals are the best way to increase your chances of hearing back from a company. If you have a strong referral, much of the above becomes less relevant. How do you get a referral? You ask. Ask around in your network to see who is hiring. Ask on public forums where tech professionals gather like Twitter or LinkedIn\u2014potentially even Blind. You can try and reach out for a cold referral: but if you do, add context on why you think you are a great fit for a job and offer an easy way out for the person to not refer you if they do not feel comfortable doing so.",
        "Cover letters are a coin toss. For larger companies, these places usually either don\u2019t ask for one, or don\u2019t pay much attention to it. At smaller firms and startups, where hiring managers are likely to read resumes and cover letters, it\u2019s a better investment to spend time on this. Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. Don\u2019t repeat your resume: add additional details that make your case stronger as to why you are a good fit for the position you are applying to.",
        "Even if you are not looking for a job today, invest in growing your professional network. The larger your network, the easier you can get referrals from people who know the professional \u201cyou.\" To grow your network, build genuine relationships with others, help people, and make yourself visible. You don\u2019t have to do this on social media: you can start right now at your workplace, within and outside your team.",
        "LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow are all sites where having an up-to-date profile will greatly help your job search. Keep your LinkedIn up to date: it\u2019s a good idea to refresh it as you write your resume. For GitHub, consider creating a GitHub README to present yourself and your key projects more effectively. Make sure projects you mention in your resume or those that you pin to your GitHub profile also have READMEs that share what the project is about. On Stack Overflow, tailor your Developer Story to make it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to find you with relevant opportunities.",
        "For more advice, tips from recruiters in tech companies, and real-world \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d resume examples that worked, you can always grab The Tech Resume Inside Out. The book is complimentary for devs currently out of a job.",

        "I like to reward initiative with increased responsibility, and if somebody has the skills and initiative to take on and outgrow the title they\u2019re hired for, I like to promote rather than risk losing a rising star to another company or team.",
        "We\u2019ll also talk a little about how these roles relate to other roles including:",
        "Note: Sometimes \u201cdirector\u201d, or \u201chead\u201d titles indicate middle managers between tech managers and the C-Suite. Often, \u201cChief\u201d titles indicate a C-suite title. C-suite employees typically report directly to the CEO, and have potentially many reports in the organizations they lead. At very large companies, those alternate titles often fill similar roles to C-suite executives, but report to somebody who is effectively the CEO of a smaller business unit within the larger organization. Different business units sometimes operate as if they are separate companies, complete with their own isolated accounting, financial officers, etc. Different business units can also have VPs, e.g., \u201cVice President of Engineering, Merchant Operations\u201d.",
        "The title \u201cfellow\u201d is the pinnacle of achievement for software engineers. It is typically awarded in recognition of people who have made outstanding contributions to the field of computing, and is usually awarded after an engineer writes a number of top selling books, wins prizes like the Turing Award, the Nobel Prize, etc. In other words, fellows are usually already famous outside the organization, and the company is trying to strengthen their brand by more strongly associating themselves with admired and influential people.",
        "In my opinion, organizations should not try to hire for \u201cfellow\u201d roles. Instead, find the best and brightest, hire them, and then grant the title (and benefits) if the engineer is deserving of it.",
        "A fellow typically also holds another title at the company. Often a CTO, Architect, VP of Engineering, or principal role, where they are in a position to lead, mentor, or serve as an example and inspiration to other members of the organization.",
        "The CEO is the position of most authority in an organization. Typically, they set the vision and north star for the company. They rally everybody around a common understanding of why the company exists, what the mission is, and what the company\u2019s values are. Frequently, CEOs are also the public face of the company, and in some cases, become synonymous with the brand (e.g., Steve Jobs with Apple, Elon Musk with Tesla/SpaceX, etc.)",
        "In some cases, CEOs are also the technical founder of a software organization, in which case, they also often fill the CTO role, and may have a VPs of Operations, Sales, Strategy, and Marketing helping with some of the other common CEO responsibilities.",
        "The CEO of a small company frequently wears a lot of hats, as you may have picked up from all the other roles that fell out of the CEO title when I mentioned that some CEOs lead the technology team.",
        "In any case, if there are important organizational decisions to be made, you can\u2019t run it up the chain of responsibility any higher than the CEO.",
        "If you are a CEO, remember that you\u2019re ultimately responsible, and you should trust your instincts, but don\u2019t forget that even most famous CEOs have mentors and advisors they consult with on a regular basis. Trust your gut, but seek out smart, insightful people to challenge you to improve, as well.",
        "Like the CEO role, the CTO role shape-shifts over time. At young startups, the CTO is often a technical cofounder to a visionary or domain-driven CEO. Frequently they are not qualified to take the title at a larger company, and hopefully grow into it as the company grows. Frequently, a startup CTO finds that they prefer more technical engineering roles, and settle back into other roles, like Principal Engineer, VP of Engineering, or Chief Architect.",
        "In many organizations, the mature CTO role is outward facing. They participate in business development meetings, frequently helping to land large partnerships or sales. Many of them hit the conference circuit and spend a lot of time evangelizing the development activities of the organization to the wider world: sharing the company\u2019s innovations and discovering opportunities in the market which match up well with the company\u2019s core competencies. CTOs frequently work closely with the product team on product strategy, and often have an internal-facing counterpart in engineering, such as the VP of Engineering.",
        "CTOs also frequently set the vision and north star of the engineering team. The goals for the team to work towards.",
        "The Chief Innovation Officer (CIO) is like a CTO, but typically employed by a company that would not normally be considered a \u201ctech company\u201d. The goal of the CIO is to reshape the company into one that consumers perceive as tech-savvy and innovative: To show the world what the future of the industry looks like, no matter what that industry is. For example, a home remodeling superstore chain might have a CIO responsible for partnering with tech companies to build a mixed reality app to show shoppers what a specific couch or wall color would look like in their living room, or using blockchains and cryptocurrencies to enhance the security and efficiency of supply chain logistics.",
        "Not to be confused with a Chief Information Officer (CIO), a title which is typically used in companies who are even more detached from technology, interested about as far as it aids their core operations. Unlike a Chief Innovation Officer, A Chief Information Officer is more likely to be leading tech integration and data migration projects than building new apps and trying to figure out how a company can disrupt itself from the inside. There are Chief Information Officers who act more like Chief Innovation Officers, but in my opinion, they should use the appropriate title.",
        "Most tech-native companies (app developers, etc) don\u2019t have either kind of CIO. Instead, those responsibilities fall to the CTO and VP of Engineering.",
        "While CTOs often face outward, the VP of Engineering often faces inward. A VP of Engineering is frequently responsible for building the engineering team and establishing the engineering culture and operations. The CTO might tell the engineering team what needs to get done on the grand scale, e.g., \u201cbe the leading innovator in human/computer interaction\u201d. The VP of Engineering helps foster a culture that manages the \u201chow\u201d. The best VPs of Engineering at first come across as somebody who\u2019s there to help the team work efficiently, and then they almost disappear. Developers on the team collaborate well, mentor each other, communicate effectively, and they think, \u201cHey, we\u2019re a great team. We work really well together!\u201d and maybe they think that\u2019s all a lucky accident.",
        "The truth is that almost never happens by accident. It happens because there\u2019s a VP of Engineering constantly monitoring the team\u2019s progress, process, culture, and tone of communications. They\u2019re encouraging developers to use certain tools, hold specific kinds of meetings at specific times in order to foster better collaboration with fewer interruptions. The best VPs of Engineering have been engineers, both on dysfunctional teams, and on highly functional teams. They know the patterns and anti-patterns for effective software development workflows.",
        "They work with the heads of product and product managers to ensure that there\u2019s a good product discovery process (they don\u2019t lead it or take charge of it, just make sure that somebody is on it and doing it well), and that product and design deliverables are adequately reviewed by engineers prior to implementation hand offs. I\u2019m going to stop there before I write a book on all the work that goes into leading effective development operations. For more of my thoughts on this topic, check out How to Build a High Velocity Development Team.",
        "Many startups are too small to hire a full time VP of Engineering, but it\u2019s still very important to get engineering culture right as early as possible. If you need help with this, reach out.",
        "At small organizations, the chief architect could be a technical co-founder with the self-awareness to realize that they won\u2019t want the responsibilities of a CTO as the company grows. Maybe they don\u2019t like to travel, or are simply more interested in software design than conference talks, business development, and sales calls that infiltrate the lives of many CTOs. The chief architect may be responsible for selecting technology stacks, designing collaborations and interfaces between computing systems, assessing compute services offerings (AWS, Azure, ZEIT Now, etc.), and so on. A chief architect may evaluate a wide range of industry offerings and make pre-approved or favored recommendations to work with particular vendors.",
        "As the company matures, the chief architect may also need to work closely with the CTO, and sometimes partner organizations to develop integrations between services. At many companies, the CTO also serves as the chief architect.",
        "A software architect serves many of the purposes of a chief architect, but is generally responsible for smaller cross-sections of functionality. Architects will often work with the chief architect to implement their slice of the larger architectural vision. Software architects often make tech stack choices for particular applications or features, rather than company-wide decisions.",
        "An Engineering Project Manager (also called \u201cEngineering Manager\u201d or simply \u201cProject Manager\u201d) is in charge of managing the workflow of an engineering team. Some larger companies have both Engineering Managers and Project Managers. In that case, the Engineering Manager typically acts like the VP of Engineering at the local team scope, while the Project Manager takes on the responsibilities described here.",
        "Project Managers typically interface with both product leaders and an engineering leader such as VP of Engineering, CTO, or a middle manager to cultivate and prune the work backlogs, track the progress of work tickets, detailed progress reports (milestone burn down charts, completed vs open tickets, month/month progress reports, etc.) You can think of them as the analog of a shop manager for a manufacturing assembly line. They watch the work floor and make sure that the assembly line runs smoothly, and work product isn\u2019t piling up on the floor in front of a bottleneck.",
        "The best Project Managers also spend a lot of time classifying issues and bugs in order to analyze metrics like bug density per feature point, what caused the most bugs (design error, spec error, logic error, syntax error, type error, etc.) and so on. Those kinds of metrics can be used to measure the effectiveness of various initiatives, and point out where improvements can be made to the engineering process.",
        "Engineering Managers tend to develop a good understanding of the strengths of various team members, and get good at assigning work tickets to the appropriate responsible parties, although, this should be a collaborative effort, seeking feedback from individual developers on what their career goals are and what they want to focus on, within the bounds of the project scope available.",
        "If there is time pressure or work backlogs piling up, the Project Manager should collaborate with the engineering and product leaders to figure out the root cause and correct the dysfunction as soon as possible.",
        "Wherever possible, the Project Managers should be the only ones directly delegating tasks to individual engineers in order to avoid the multiple bosses problem. Engineers should have a clear idea of who they report directly to, and who\u2019s in charge of delegating to them. If you\u2019re a different kind of engineering leader, and you\u2019re guilty of delegating directly to engineers, it\u2019s probably a good idea to coordinate with the Engineering Manager in charge of the report you\u2019re delegating to and delegate through them so that the work receives correct, coordinated prioritization, and the Engineering Manager is aware of what each engineer is actively working on at any given moment.",
        "At very small organizations, the Engineering Manager is often also the CTO and VP of Engineering (with or without the corresponding titles). If that\u2019s you, don\u2019t worry about the previous paragraph.",
        "A common dysfunction is that the Engineering Manager can begin to think that because product hands off work for engineering to implement, and Engineering Managers work closely with product teams, that the Engineering Manager reports to a Product Manager. In every case I\u2019ve seen that happen, it was a mistake. See \u201cAvoiding Dysfunctions\u2026\u201d below.",
        "The Tech Lead or Team Lead is usually the leader of a small number of developers. They are usually senior engineers who act like mentors, examples, and guides for the rest of the team. Usually, engineers report to the project manager or engineering manager, but a tech lead may be responsible for the team\u2019s code quality measures, such as ensuring that adequate code reviews are being conducted, and that the team\u2019s technical standards (such as TDD) are being upheld.",
        "Generally, engineers can take one of two career paths: move into management, or keep coding. Management positions aren\u2019t for everyone. Lots of engineers prefer to stay on the technical path. That progression can take many directions, twists, and turns, but could look something like this:",
        "Intern -> Junior Software Developer -> Software Developer/Engineer -> Senior Software Engineer -> Principal Software Engineer -> Software Architect -> Senior Software Architect -> Chief Architect -> CTO -> Engineering Fellow",
        "Alternatively, for those engineers interested in a people leadership role, a progression might look something like this:",
        "Intern -> Junior Software Developer -> Software Developer/Engineer -> Team Lead/Tech Lead -> Engineering Manager/Project Manager -> Senior Engineering Manager -> Director of Engineering -> VP of Engineering",
        "IMO, VP of Engineering, CTO, VP of Product, and VP of Marketing should all report directly to the CEO. Each of them needs to be in charge of their own process. External facing CTOs should not have direct reports (if they do, it usually means they are filling both the CTO and VP of Engineering Roles). Instead, the Engineering leaders report to the VP of Engineering. This is to avoid the two bosses dysfunction, but also because these roles are fundamentally different: one focused on the customer and how the organization fits into the wider world, and the other focused on internal, day-to-day operations. They\u2019re two wildly different skill sets, with sometimes competing priorities.",
        "I\u2019ve seen a lot of dysfunction in engineering leadership because of confusion about which engineering leaders are responsible for what, and it tends to be a recipe for disaster. Whatever is right for your organization, make sure that responsibilities and chain of authority are clear, in order to avoid engineers feeling torn between two or three different \u201cbosses\u201d.",
        "Likewise, in an organization of sufficient size, product and engineering need to be two separately led teams. What I mean by that is that the product managers should own the product roadmap. They should be evangelists for the users, and they should be really plugged into the users, often engaging with them 1:1 and learning about their workflows and pain-points in great depth. They should be experts on what the market needs, and they should be very familiar with the company\u2019s strengths and capabilities to fill those needs.",
        "That said, the VP of Engineering (or whomever is filling that role) needs to be in charge of delivery, and production pace. While the product managers should own the roadmap, the engineering managers need to be responsible for taking those roadmap priorities, matching them to the engineering capacity, and reporting on the timing. Product and marketing teams will have strong opinions about when something should ship, but only the engineering management has a good gauge of whether or not those delivery timelines are possible given the roadmap requirements. The engineering team needs the authority not simply to push back on timing, but in most cases, to completely own timing, working with the CEO, product, and marketing teams to figure out priorities, understand strategic needs of the company, and then help shape a development cadence that can meet those needs without imposing drop-dead deadlines that ultimately hurt the company\u2019s ability to deliver quality products at a reliable pace.",
        "The best performing teams I\u2019ve ever been involved with subscribed to the no deadlines approach. We build great products without announcing them in advance, and then let the marketing teams promote work that is already done. Alternatively, when you\u2019re working in the public view, transparency is a great solution. Instead of cramming to meet an arbitrary deadline, actively share your progress, with ticket burn-down charts, a clear view of remaining work, progress, pace, and remaining scope, and change over time that can indicate scope creep. When you share detailed information about the progress being made, and share the philosophy that we can\u2019t promise a delivery date, but we can share everything we know about our progress with you, people can see for themselves the work and the pace.",
        "Because of differing, often competing goals, product, marketing and engineering need to be separate roles reporting directly to the CEO where none of them can dictate to each other. If your team feels time pressure to work overtime, or crunch to get some key deliverable out before some drop-dead deadline, it points to a dysfunction here. Either the engineering managers are reporting to the wrong people, or the team lacks a strong engineering leader who understands the futility of software estimates and the need for a collaborative give-and-take between engineering and product in order to ensure the flexibility of shipping scaled-back MVPs to hit delivery targets.",
        "Product should own the continuous discovery process. Engineering should own the continuous delivery process. Marketing should work hand-in-hand with the product team to ensure that product messaging to the wider world is on-point. The whole thing should fit together like a pipeline, creating a smoothly flowing, positive feedback cycle. Like an assembly line, the slowest bottleneck in the process must set the pace for the rest of the process, otherwise, it will lead to an ever-growing backlog that piles up so much that backlog items become obsolete, and backlog management becomes a full-time job.",
        "Product teams who feel like engineering is not keeping pace should focus first on quality of engineering hand-off deliverables. Have we done adequate design review? Has an engineer had a chance to provide constructive feedback before handoff? 80% of software bugs are caused by specification or UX design errors, and many of those can be caught before work ever gets handed off to an engineering team. Once you have that process finely tuned, ask yourself if you\u2019ve really explored the product design space thoroughly enough. Did you build one UX and call it done, or did you try multiple variations? Building and testing variations on user workflows is one of the most valuable contributions a product team can make. Do you have a group of trusted users or customers you can run A/B prototype tests with?",
        "One of the biggest dysfunctions of software teams is that the product team is producing sub-par deliverables (sometimes little more than a few rushed, buggy mock-ups), and failing to run any of them by customers or engineers prior to handing them off. That dysfunction causes a pileup of re-work and engineering backlog that often gets blamed on engineering teams.",
        "Make sure that the delegation of responsibilities makes sense, that you\u2019re not putting undue time pressure on engineering, and that you have a great product team engaged in a collaborative product discovery process, working with real users to build the best product.",
        "Engineering managers, I\u2019m not letting you off the hook. If these dysfunctions exist on your team, it\u2019s your responsibility to address them with product, marketing, and business leadership, and spearhead requirements for engineering hand-offs. It\u2019s also your responsibility to protect the productive pace of your team, go to bat for additional resources if your team is being pressured to produce more than your current capacity can handle, to report clearly on the work pacing and backlog, and to demo completed work and ensure that your team is getting due credit for the fine work that is being done.",

        "In my experience employers have cared very little about my past years of work experience outside tech so I really just had to go by whatever I did after.",
        "This is regardless of recruiter or no recruiter. Maybe look into networking through events and meetups where you live (I hear good things about the recurse center, which I think might still offer a remote option if you\u2019re not in NY).",
        "Still, it\u2019s very possible. You just have to stay positive, stick to it, adapt to be competitive, and potentially have to wait a good while.",
        "(obviously this is all subjective, take everything you read with a grain of salt)",
        "Well, thanks for the soberingly honest answer!",
        "Gosh, I hope this isn\u2019t universal. I\u2019m in my 50s trying to get out of teaching (secondary science) and just doing the odd bit of Codecademy when I have time in the hope of securing a tech job in 2 years or so. I hope I\u2019m not wasting my time!",
        "Depends on expectations. Look up what kind of companies and roles you\u2019re interested in and read/ask around specifically about what is needed to get in realistically. Then see if you can try to match that in terms of study, paths, etc.",
        "This has been a major difficulty for me (and one I\u2019ve posted about on here before). As someone who\u2019s brand new to learning these skills and to seeking a tech job, what I\u2019m interested in, first and foremost, is whatever will hire me. Sure, I have my interests and my preferences, but since it\u2019s all new to me, it\u2019s kind of all the same. So my question is never \u201cwhat do the roles that I\u2019m interested in require?\u201d; my question is \u201cwhat job can I most realistically get?\u201d.For instance, I\u2019m pretty good with Python and haven\u2019t learned C#, but if I found out right now that there are tons of entry-level C# jobs but not so much with Python, I\u2019d go learn C# and look for jobs that way.",

It\u2019s like if I was out in the rain and looking to get inside: I\u2019m not interested in a particular TYPE of building, I just want whatever will let me inside so I can have a roof over my head.",

If you\u2019re trying to go at it from what potential jobs will take you, you\u2019d have to take a sample listing of entry level positions for roles you\u2019d be willing to take (software engineer, QA tester, data analyst, cybersec, etc) and see the combo of where you are the closest to combined with which has the better ratio of supply and demand.",
        "Even within a general role, there are specific specializations that some companies favor. For example with software engineer, you can have people that have data engineering toolsets, devops, site reliability engineering, web dev, game dev, operating systems, database engineering, etc.",
        "For example cybersecurity often requires certificates, while certain sectors of software engineering are happy to take people with no college degree (while others only look at people with college degrees). Many software engineering roles heavily prefer people than can solve a good range of leetcode problems comfortably, etc. Machine learning roles usually require some form of master\u2019s degree. The list goes on and the permutations are very large.",

        "For reference, on my end I am familiar with what early level software engineering roles require (only in the US). So I can give you feedback if you say, i have x, y, and z, i might be able to say if you get a, b, and c it might help your chances.",

        "In an ideal world, you wouldn\u2019t need a resume. You\u2019d have a recruiter reach out to you along the lines of: \u201cYour ex-colleague Bob spoke extremely highly of your time working at Stack Overflow. Our company is growing, and we\u2019d love to talk with you. Do you have time to chat with a few members of the team next Wednesday?\u201d",
        "However, in reality, you will, at some point, find yourself applying at a company where Bob is not there to vouch for you, so you cannot skip through the process of being evaluated before the team will talk to you.",
        "I\u2019ve been a hiring manager for numerous companies and typically go through hundreds of resumes per year. I\u2019ve also researched the topic of writing a developer resume that represents you well while writing the book The Tech Resume Inside Out: What a Good Developer Resume Looks Like. For the book, I ended up talking with two dozen recruiters and hiring managers at the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Transferwise, and other well-known companies.",
        "Based on that experience, here are the seven pieces of advice that I give to engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "Many engineers assume their resume should just contain highlights of their employment history. They\u2019ve seen other people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles and seen a few resumes. Most of these look like this, and companies must be interested in what you did. Right?",
        "Wrong.",
        "The goal of your resume is to sell you enough to get a recruiter phone call and continue the process. This is a very different goal from telling your entire professional story. Your goal should be to showcase to the company why you\u2019re a good fit for the position they are recruiting for.",
        "This means highlighting parts of your resume that show you being a great match for a specific position. Tuning it to fit the opening might be as simple as changing the order of things or adding specific details that only this position might find interesting. When you have lots of experience, this might mean cutting less relevant parts short and leaving irrelevant things off.",
        "Here\u2019s how a typical hiring manager and recruiter will read your resume:",
        "1. Quick scan. They\u2019ll do a short scan of a few seconds, gathering all key information. Your location, years of experience, languages and technologies, position names, company names, and anything else that stands out.",
        "2. Second read. Assuming this first scan matches what they\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll re-read your resume, top to bottom, reading the content you wrote. However, if, in the quick scan, it didn\u2019t seem that you have what the position needs, there will be no second read.",
        "You should choose a resume format that helps highlight the key information the recruiter or hiring manager looks for in that first scan. A good resume template follows these principles:",
        "Why bother spending the time finding a good template? The less effort it is for a recruiter to get the key information in the quick scan, the more time they\u2019ll have to look at other parts of your resume. Here\u2019s a resume template you could use\u2014I created this template for the book, and it satisfies all the above requirements. Of course, there are many others to choose from, and you can also design your own.",
        "The recruiter or hiring manager will read your resume top to bottom. You\u2019ll want the most relevant parts to be at the top and less relevant ones towards the bottom. When you have lots of experience, it\u2019s fine to go beyond just one page: just make sure that everything relevant is still on the first page.",
        "When you\u2019re a new grad or bootcamp grad, hiring managers usually care about experience in this order:",
        "When you have work experience, the way a recruiter reads your resume changes. Here is what will be most relevant:",
        "With lots of work experience, you start to stand out from the crowd of applicants. At the same time, you\u2019ll probably have more experience than would fit on a page or two. In this case, a one-page resume is no longer a must-have, but you\u2019ll want to be more concise in your earlier experience: especially when that experience is not as relevant. Here\u2019s the order you could consider structuring your resume:",
        "It can feel painful to cut away some of your experience from your resume. But keep in mind your goal: it\u2019s to have that recruiter call. I collaborated with a systems administrator turned developer who had 20 years of experience. Ten years ago, they went back to college to get a computer science degree. Their original resume had all 20 years of experience listed: non-CS degree, ten years working as a systems admin, CS degree, ten years as a developer. The first ten years did not add much professionally to their resume: they ended up removing this, but still keeping their first, non-CS degree there. The new resume was cleaner, and they saw more callbacks with it.",
        "While you don\u2019t need to remove old positions, you should aim to reduce detail mentions significantly, except if they would add something very valuable for your current job application.",
        "Keep regional and cultural differences in mind as you craft your resume. For example, in most of the US, a one-page resume is the norm for developers with less than a few years\u2019 experience. Even more senior people aim to fit everything important on the first page. In most of Europe, resumes of two pages are common, and some hiring managers actually prefer to read longer resumes for senior people. Whatever the length, make sure you communicate the relevant parts first. Use the space wisely, elaborating more on your experiences and results that relate to the position you are applying for.",
        "Positions hiring for generalist software engineers will want to see some evidence that you have worked with a few technologies. For these places, it\u2019s a good sign if you\u2019ve mastered multiple technologies. Positions hiring for specific technologies will want to confirm that you did meaningful work with those technologies.",
        "There are a few ways you could make it clear what languages and technologies you are proficient with:",
        "1. Have a separate section for \u201clanguages and technologies\u201d on the first page of your resume.",
        "In this section, list out areas you are proficient with. Don\u2019t bother specifying your expertise level: the hiring manager will assume you know these well enough if you listed them. An example of this approach can look like this:",
        "2. Call out languages and technologies that you used as part of your work experience.",
        "An alternative to the previous approach is to mention the tools you used in each position. This gives more context on when you used these technologies or frameworks and what problems you solved using them. You could just list these out separately at the end of each position like this:",
        "However, I recommend \u201cweaving in\u201d the languages and technologies to the description itself. This both reads better, and you can give even more context:",
        "One thing I wish more resumes had is specifics. The majority of CVs I\u2019ve read tend to list responsibilities, what work was assigned, or have a hand-wavy explanation of the work. Here\u2019s an example of a resume snippet that recruiters and hiring managers see all too commonly:",
        "While the person writing these details probably felt they were showcasing the work they were doing\u2014the hiring manager gets little to no context on the specifics of the work. To stand out, be specific. To be specific, follow this approach:",
        "Having a \u201cmaster\u201d resume and tailoring it for every position you apply for is a great strategy. The tailoring doesn\u2019t have to be drastic. However, if you are applying for a company where the job listing lists the stack as React and Node\u2014and you have experience with these, among other languages\u2014moving these up front could be a small change with a big impact. Similarly, if you\u2019ve done work similar to what the position is asking for, having these bullet points listed first are all good ways to grab the attention of the person reading the resume earlier.",
        "One last thing I need to call out, as developers seeking jobs bring it up: the application tracking systems (ATS), and robots \u201crejecting\u201d your resume. This is false. Your resume will be read by a human. At tech companies, ATSes do not \u201creject\u201d resumes, and \u201crobot rejection\u201d does not exist in tech. Be wary of any resource that claims this is true: they are probably using the tactic to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt as an incentive for you to buy their service. I\u2019m saying this both as a hiring manager who has worked with ATSes and as an author who interviewed recruiters at all major tech companies. I asked them about robot rejections; they all confirmed that they have not seen or heard of such a practice.",
        "Applying for a job does not end with having a good resume. A few things can greatly help your job search: referrals, cover letters, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.",
        "Employee referrals are the best way to increase your chances of hearing back from a company. If you have a strong referral, much of the above becomes less relevant. How do you get a referral? You ask. Ask around in your network to see who is hiring. Ask on public forums where tech professionals gather like Twitter or LinkedIn\u2014potentially even Blind. You can try and reach out for a cold referral: but if you do, add context on why you think you are a great fit for a job and offer an easy way out for the person to not refer you if they do not feel comfortable doing so.",
        "Cover letters are a coin toss. For larger companies, these places usually either don\u2019t ask for one, or don\u2019t pay much attention to it. At smaller firms and startups, where hiring managers are likely to read resumes and cover letters, it\u2019s a better investment to spend time on this. Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. Don\u2019t repeat your resume: add additional details that make your case stronger as to why you are a good fit for the position you are applying to.",
        "Even if you are not looking for a job today, invest in growing your professional network. The larger your network, the easier you can get referrals from people who know the professional \u201cyou.\" To grow your network, build genuine relationships with others, help people, and make yourself visible. You don\u2019t have to do this on social media: you can start right now at your workplace, within and outside your team.",
        "LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow are all sites where having an up-to-date profile will greatly help your job search. Keep your LinkedIn up to date: it\u2019s a good idea to refresh it as you write your resume. For GitHub, consider creating a GitHub README to present yourself and your key projects more effectively. Make sure projects you mention in your resume or those that you pin to your GitHub profile also have READMEs that share what the project is about. On Stack Overflow, tailor your Developer Story to make it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to find you with relevant opportunities.",
        "For more advice, tips from recruiters in tech companies, and real-world \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d resume examples that worked, you can always grab The Tech Resume Inside Out. The book is complimentary for devs currently out of a job.",

        "There are chapters in books lamenting the feeling that someone in the tech industry gets from the constant recruiter outreach.",
        "Recruiters, are just cold calling. They don\u2019t care who you are \u2014 you\u2019re just 10% of your first year\u2019s salary. And they\u2019re the main reason I never pick up my phone. (Paraphrased from Michael Lopp \u2014 Being Geek)",

        "No one ever explained to me that recruiters are also one of the best career resources you can find.",

        "All of the advice around aligning your long term goals with compensation hold true. Don\u2019t let your own dreams of swimming in a scrooge mcduck style swimming pool full of money cloud your vision. Don\u2019t risk burnout, the market is hot, another offer is just around the corner.",

    "219: Finding a New Software Developer Job | Henrik Warne's blog": [
        "For the first time ever, I was laid off, and had to find a new software developer job. I managed to find a new one, but it took longer than I thought, and it was a lot of work. I was in contact with 30 companies, got a no from 8 companies,\u2002no reply from 6 companies, and offers from 3 companies. Here is what I learnt from the process.",
        "",
        "At the end of October last year, I lost my job. I was completely surprised, but in retrospect, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been that surprised. The times were getting tougher, and many companies had been laying off people during all of 2023. If the company is not making enough money, eventually there will be layoffs. In my case, we were 17 people let go that day, including 8 developers.",
        "A few minutes after I had the Zoom call with the CEO, my access to all company resources was cut off. Apart from not being able to finish what I was working on (I had several unpushed changes), it becomes harder to say goodbye to everybody. Many of my colleagues reached out on LinkedIn, which was great. Some even set up Zoom calls so we could talk about what had happened, and say a proper goodbye, which I really appreciated.",
        "Being let go was a new experience for me. The closest I have been in the past is during the dot com bust, when the project I was working on at Ericsson was cut. They were not yet laying people off (that came a bit later), so we were offered other roles within Ericsson. But I decided to change to another company instead (they reached out directly to me, since I had worked with them at Ericsson). All the other times I have changed jobs, it\u2019s been on my own initiative, while still being employed. I typically stayed on for three months (the standard notice period in Sweden), finishing up what I was working on, before starting at the new company.",
        "The upside of being cut off immediately is that I could immediately spend all of my time looking for a new job, while still getting paid for some time. Even though I was surprised that I was let go, I didn\u2019t panic. My philosophy has always been that I should be prepared to find a new job at any time, since you never know what will happen. So I keep a list of companies that I would like to work at. I also stay friendly with recruiters that contact me, in case I need to get back to them.",
        "I started looking for another job immediately. The best source for this was LinkedIn, but I found some jobs through other means.",
        "Open to work. The first thing I did was to change my LinkedIn \u201copen to work\u201d status to \u201cImmediately, I\u2019m actively applying\u201d (from \u201cFlexible, I am casually looking\u201d, which I normally use). I kept the visibility to recruiters only, not all LinkedIn members (which would set the green #OpenToWork photo frame). I have seen arguments for and against using #OpenToWork \u2013 it lets more people know you are looking, versus it makes you look desperate. It is hard to know which is better, but I decided to only let recruiters know.",
        "As soon as I changed this setting, I got contacted by maybe five recruiters per day for the first week or so. I suppose the LinkedIn algorithm alerts recruiters to people that have just changed their status. The quality of the roles was about the same as I normally get (albeit at a much higher rate) \u2013 some I really liked, some were OK, and some were definitely not for me.",
        "Applying to known companies. Next, I went through my list of companies I would like to work for, and looked to see if they had any open developer roles. I first looked on the company page on LinkedIn, then clicked on the Jobs tab. Many of the companies were actively recruiting. A good thing when you click on an ad is that you can see how many people have applied, and how old the ad is. Sometimes I would also go to the company home page and look at their career page. But I found it convenient to go through LinkedIn, where the format is the same, and you can see if any of your contacts work there. Sometimes you can also see who has posted the ad.",
        "Job ads. I also looked through job ads on LinkedIn. There is a search function, and I tried different searches, for example \u201cGolang Stockholm\u201d. It works well enough, and I would click on anything that looked interesting. LinkedIn also has a \u201cRecommended for you\u201d-section and \u201cJobs where you\u2019d be a top applicant\u201d-section (only if you have Premium), and I guess they use your skills and previous searches to populate these. These also showed a good selection of job ads.",
        "There are however two problems. The first is that searching for fully remote jobs is unreliable. Sometimes it turns up good ads, but sometimes it turns up roles that are e.g. remote only in the UK. It would be good to be able to search for fully remote roles in Sweden, fully remote in EU, or fully remote worldwide.",
        "The second problem is that it is not possible to get only the latest ads, for example ads that are less than a week old. So I ended up having to page through a lot of ads I had already seen. After I had found a new job, I saw a good solution for this in a tweet: use Google, set the time interval to last week, and search for e.g. \u201cgolang fully remote site:linkedin.com/jobs\u201d.",
        "Reaching out. I also reached out to around 15 recruiters that had contacted me on LinkedIn in the past, but nothing came out of that. I knew that the roles they contacted me for would not be open, but I thought that they might be recruiting for something similar. On a few occasions I sent a direct message (InMail) to managers that were recruiting (some encouraged you to do this in their bios), but I don\u2019t think I got a single response. Perhaps I was not a good enough fit, but it was still disappointing.",
        "In Sweden there is a site that is matching developers with employers called Demando. You fill out a profile, listing your skills, and giving a minimum salary you will accept. Companies advertise jobs there too, and you get a message if there is a match. I already had an inactive profile there that I activated, setting a relatively high minimum salary. I got contacted by one company there, which I later got an offer from. I also found a job ad there for a company I would like to work for. I did not find that ad on LinkedIn. I applied to them, and got an offer from them too. So pretty good payoff from using that site.",
        "I also briefly looked at a site called RemoteOK, but didn\u2019t find anything that I applied to there. My general sense was that the quality of job ads there was much lower than on LinkedIn. I also had a look at Efianancialcareers, but there are almost no fully remote roles there (and they are hard to search for). On the first of every month, there is Hacker News thread called Who\u2019s hiring. I looked there briefly too, but I found it too hard to find something relevant there.",
        "I later found another good way of finding companies to check to see if they have any open roles: google \u201ccompetitor to\u201d or \u201calternative to\u201d and a company name, to find similar companies.",
        "All recruiters I was in contact with asked for my CV, even though it is mostly the same information that is already on my LinkedIn profile. It is almost as if it is a sign that you are serious. This is fine with me, since once I had an up-to-date CV, I just attached that one. When applying to companies directly, most companies ask for a CV (even when including your LinkedIn profile), and many also asked for a cover letter. I saved all the cover letters I wrote, and when I needed to write a new one, I copied the most similar previous one I had, and modified it to fit the new application.",
        "Soon after I started to send out applications, I created an Excel sheet to keep track of my applications. I included company name, date the application was sent, recruiter or contact person, and a column for general notes. Looking at it now, it has 30 entries, but I didn\u2019t send applications to all of them. In some cases, I added an entry after speaking to a recruiter, but then nothing came of it.",
        "6 companies I applied to never responded at all. In some cases, the ad was more than a month old. But if the ad is no longer relevant, they should take it down instead of leaving it up and not responding. In some cases, I tried to contact the recruiter that had posted the ad, but I didn\u2019t get a response that way either.",
        "Ideally, all companies should respond. But I don\u2019t mind too much if I don\u2019t get a response if I haven\u2019t been in contact with a person at the company. However, if I have had an interview with them, I think they should at least let you know if they are not interested. At one company, I had an initial interview with a recruiter at the company. She said she would set up an interview with a manager. Then crickets. I mailed her after two weeks, asking what was happening, but didn\u2019t get a response. Two weeks later, I sent another mail saying I was no longer interested, and got an half-hearted apology back (but no reason for why she never got back to me). So this exchange now colors my view of that company.",
        "I have never had LinkedIn Premium before, but I decided this was a good time to try it, so I paid for a month. However, it was quite disappointing. Maybe I could see more profile viewers, I am not sure, but it is definitely not showing who all of them are. And even if it had been, it has limited value in a job search. I also got a number of InMails to send each month (maybe 5?). I sent a couple, but they were not very useful for me either. Then there was the \u201cJobs where you\u2019d be a top applicant\u201d, but that too wasn\u2019t very useful for me. So I cancelled after one month. Before cancelling, I had the option of extending it for two months for the price of one.",
        "I also paid for a GoLand license for two months (quite expensive), since I was looking for Go jobs and wanted to practice in an environment I am used to. I signed up for Github CoPilot too, because I wanted to try it. It\u2019s quite good, but I didn\u2019t use it much, because I wanted to make sure I did all coding by myself at interviews. I already had a subscription to ChatGPT, and that came in very handy for many take-home assignments.",
        "I signed up for Leetcode too, as I have done in the past when preparing for interviews. Mostly I like the paid version because you can get the editorial explanation for the solutions. I practiced a bit in Leetcode, so it was worth the expense. One company used an IQ test from Alva labs, so I paid for a practice course called Alva Logic Cram Course from 12minprep (there were lots of vendors, but this was relatively cheap). It was definitely worth it, I did much better on the test than I would have, had I not practiced beforehand.",
        "Times are definitely harder now compared to the previous decade. There were still many open positions to apply for, but it looked like there were many more applicants for each role than in the past. On LinkedIn, where you can see how many applicants there are, many job ads would have more than a hundred applicants. Further evidence of times being tougher is the number of companies that I never heard back from, even though I believe I would be great for the role.",
        "There is also a big focus on having experience in a given language. In the past, I have started a job developing in Python without any Python experience. The same for Golang. It didn\u2019t take me long to get productive in each language. Partly this is because many imperative languages are very similar. Of course, knowing the libraries and ecosystems is good, but in my experience not strictly necessary. But many recruiters now told me that it was a hard requirement from the hiring companies to have at least two or three years\u2019 experience in the given language.",
        "For a typical job there were four or five interviews: an initial interview with a recruiter, an interview with a hiring manager, one or two technical interviews (either live coding, or going through a take-home assignment). There could also be an interview with a product manager, and/or one with a CTO or founder. All in all, quite a time commitment.",
        "I was applying for both local and remote roles. For the remote ones, all interviews were naturally on Zoom/Meet/Teams. For local jobs in Stockholm, most companies wanted in-person interviews. This caused some problems, because it takes time to travel into the city. I could easily do many remote interviews in a day, but one in-person interview would take half a day with commuting. Mostly I managed to schedule in-person interviews on the same days, which helped. The advantage of the in-person interviews is that you get a better feel for the other person, and you can see what the office looks like.",
        "Since before, I had a Word document that I called Interview Tips. In it I wrote down things to think about before an interview, in a format that is easy to review quickly. One section I added now was Behavioral Questions. These are questions of the form \u201cTell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?\u201d. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. In the past, I have failed interviews because of these questions \u2013 I hadn\u2019t prepared, and couldn\u2019t come up with good examples on the spot in the interviews.",
        "This time I went through a good list of such questions (Rock the Behavioral Interview) from Leetcode, and thought about examples to use. Once I had good examples, I wrote the question and my answer down in the document. Before an interview, I would review what I had written down, so I would be able to come up with good examples. This worked well, I didn\u2019t fail any interviews because of behavioral questions.",
        "In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. I tried to cover many common patterns and idioms. I did this so I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn\u2019t made any mistake, and included relevant output. Reviewing these snippets before an interview made me feel calmer and more prepared.",
        "I also watched a good video by Gergely Orosz, Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews, on technical interviews in general. Some takeaways: be curious and collaborative, and ask questions.",
        "In all my initial interviews, I was open with the fact that I had been let go from my previous job due to cut backs. I didn\u2019t seem like disclosing this was to my disadvantage. I was never nervous talking to recruiters or managers \u2013 I always knew what to say, since I had done it many times, both in the past and for this round of interviews. It is easy for me to articulate what I am looking for in a job, and what my strengths are, because it is very clear in my mind. I was also not nervous before non-coding technical interviews, since I feel I know most technologies I have worked with quite well.",
        "However, I was nervous when I had coding interviews. I don\u2019t exactly know why, but my brain seems to work at only 50% capacity every time I have to do live coding. So, it can be hard for me to come up with a solution, or remember some syntax, when trying to solve a problem. Luckily, all live coding interviews went well this time, but probably mostly because I had prepared a lot.",
        "Of all non-coding interviews, I failed only one (I failed several coding and take-home assignments though). For the one I failed, I was asked what timeout I would set on a database connection. I was more thinking about how long an individual user could be prepared to wait for a page to render, so blurted out too high of a number. This was enough to fail an interview that otherwise went pretty well.",
        "Compared to when I last interviewed a few years ago, there were more take-home assignments this time. Take-home assignments are a lot less stressful than live coding, but they also take much more time. Regardless of what the companies claim, I would say each assignment took at least six hours. There is an unfortunate asymmetry here: it is easy for a company to demand that you do a take-home assignment early on in the process, with almost no cost in effort to them. For the job-seeker, it is at least six hours of work that may or may not pay off. Even so, I noticed that each time I got going with an assignment, I loved the programming \u2013 being immersed in a task, structuring the code well, finding good names etc. It was extra obvious because I wasn\u2019t programming as much as when I had a developer job.",
        "I did five take-home assignments, two in Java, two in Python, and one in Go. I failed one and a half. For the Go assignment, I wrote a working solution, but did not include tests. This wasn\u2019t stated as a requirement, but I should have included some even so (when developing the solution, I used a more interactive approach, which meant running the code a lot as I developed). That assignment was also failed because I did not include caching to speed it up (to me it was not clear that it would be run more than once though).",
        "The other assignment, I failed because of hidden test cases and sloppy coding from me. The task was really good \u2013 I was given test cases, but no implementation. I implemented enough of the system to pass all the existing test cases. My instinct told me that I should add more test cases on my own (that\u2019s what I would have done if this was on the job). However, I thought that I had already spent a lot of time on it, so I didn\u2019t. When we went through my solution in the interview afterwards, they had run some extra (hidden) test cases on my solution, and discovered two errors in my code. Both had to do with cases with empty input. I felt really stupid for not being more careful implementing the solution. In the end, I still got an offer from that company, and that\u2019s why I am counting it as only half a failure.",
        "For the take-home assignments, it was quite helpful to have access to ChatGPT. Getting a working framework up for what I wanted to do was a lot quicker that way.",
        "Of the live coding assignments, I passed three and failed two. In the first one I failed, I had to write a limited chess program, that only supported two kinds of pieces. It needed a project structure, a data model, valid movements for the pieces, and tests. I started from nothing, and I had to send the solution in within two hours. It was very tight and stressful. I got most of it working, but not all functionality. I also had a bug in the movement code. That combination made it a fail.",
        "The other live coding was less well prepared from the company. I downloaded a repo from Github with some initial code. But there were no working tests, and it took a while to set up an environment to work in. I also had to ask many questions on how the logic was supposed to work (with 50% of my brain capacity), and in the end I took too long. For all live coding tests, I used the IDE on my computer, and shared the screen over Zoom.",
        "A couple of times in the beginning, I gave too high of a salary number, resulting in cancelled interviews. So I changed my tactics to instead tell them what my salary had been each year for the past four years, to give them a sense of what I was ideally looking at (I had had quite good salaries). Often, they would say \u201cwell, we can\u2019t pay that\u201d. To this I would respond that since I currently don\u2019t have a job, I don\u2019t really have a minimum acceptable salary, it will depend on what they (and others) can offer. This would often mean that we could continue the process. Sometimes it also meant that I had a chance to show what I had to offer, which might later translate to a better offer than they initially intended.",
        "Once I had my first offer, it became easier. Surprisingly often when I asked the companies what the salary range for the role was, I would get an answer. This was really good, because I could say no to the ones that offered less than I was prepared to accept. In one case, I didn\u2019t check what salary they were prepared to pay. I only found out when I got an offer from them (after a lot of interviews and a take-home assignment). I did this because I really liked the company, but their offer was very low. In hindsight, I should have checked upfront, instead of wasting a lot of time and effort on them.",
        "Even before this job-hunting round, I had quite a good sense of what salaries companies in Stockholm pay developers. It got even better after talking to many companies. In Sweden, you think in terms of the monthly salary. You also have to consider if pension contributions are included or not (in most cases they are included, and can be an additional 10 to 15 percent, which is implicitly included). A very average developer salary would be 55K \u2013 65K SEK per month. Almost all companies are prepared to pay that. Getting a salary of 80K a month and over is more difficult, but definitely not impossible, even in a tight market. In addition to salary, many companies can offer options or equity, and/or a bonus.",
        "In the end, you also have to weigh other aspects of the job. How interesting is the product and company? What language will you work in? What will you learn? Who will your colleagues be?",
        "One company I interviewed with was very positive, and ended up asking for two references, which I provided. But the next day, they announced that they would go with another candidate. I was quite surprised, since I thought I would get an offer from them. It\u2019s ok if they find somebody else, but I was upset that they wasted the time of two of my references. The recruiter later apologized and said that she was convinced they wanted to give me an offer, but the manager had picked somebody else. I don\u2019t know\u2002what to think, but it was quite a disappointment.",
        "Even if you fail to get offers at most companies you apply to, you only need to have one where you are successful. In a sense it is a numbers game \u2013 go through enough processes so that you get at least one offer.",
        "In the end, I had three and a half offers to choose from (I didn\u2019t formally get an offer from one of the companies, mostly because I knew it would pay less than two of the offers I already had, so I am only counting it as a half). I managed to get them more or less at the same time. I tried to slow some companies down, and speed other ones up, by delaying interviews, or being able to have interviews as soon as possible.",
        "I was lucky to have more than one offer, because then I was in a much better negotiating position. The top two offers were both very good, and I could see my self taking either. In the end I got everything I was looking for \u2013 a very interesting job, and a good salary.",
        "Stressful. Looking for a new job is a lot of work. It is hard to relax, even on weekends, because there is always some interview preparation you can do. It wasn\u2019t until I had a firm job offer that I could enjoy my time off (I had a few weeks off before I started).",
        "Takes time. I thought it would be quicker to find a new job. But there are four or five interviews to schedule, and often a take-home assignment to do. You also want to read up on the company and product. Then the companies usually can\u2019t schedule the interviews as fast as you would like. Add that you will fail interviews, and the process can easily take months.",
        "A numbers game. Even if you fail a lot of interviews, it only takes one company where you are successful for you to have a new job. So apply to many. I also realized that I am bad at judging if I did well or not. Almost every time I was rejected, I was surprised.",
        "People to discuss with. I have two former colleagues, Patrik and Peter, that I discussed my jobhunting process with. These discussions were really useful. There are so many aspects to consider, and having somebody who understands to talk to helps immensely!",
        "Responsive recruiters. Recruiters that consistently get back to you quickly are great! It is such a simple way to build confidence in the company they represent, yet so many recruiters really are bad at it.",
        "Reach out. If a colleague of yours is let go, reach out to them (through LinkedIn or other means) to say goodbye. It meant a lot to me, and I think most people would appreciate it.",
        "I am lucky. I love programming, and I have a lot of experience. Even in a tougher market it was  comparatively easy for me. It still took a lot of work, but I ended up with a great new job as a senior developer at Swissblock. I hope my jobhunting experience can be helpful to other developers looking for their next jobs.",
        "Congratulations on your new job!",
        "When I helped interview candidates, 19 out of 20 candidates flunked the FizzBuzz test, and couldn\u2019t write any code whatsoever. So when I went looking for a job I expected simple tests. I was entirely wrong! Like you write, modern tests require speed coding in unknown IDEs, libraries, and web and test frameworks. I thought it was a ridiculous way to test applicants.",
        "You write that GoLand is quite expensive.  I see JetBrain lists GoLand for 30 euro a month so I assume that\u2019s not it. What GoLand do you mean?",

I have a GitHub with some small personal projects on it, and I\u2019m continuing to learn more and to work on more projects. I\u2019ve been finding that the learning part is relatively easy; it\u2019s figuring out how to navigate an unfamiliar job market that\u2019s tricky.",
        "A friend suggested I look into tech recruiters, who might be able to help me get a job in exchange for a commission or a cut of my salary or something like that.",
        "How feasible is this? Are there recruiters who\u2019d help a rookie (with a lot of non-tech professional experience) like me find a job? Or do recruiters typically want people with more of a professional background than I have so far?",
        "It depends on the job you\u2019re aiming for and your portfolio. Right now entry-level software engineer is tough for people that just graduated with computer science degrees (I have friends that just graduated in CS this past June that haven\u2019t landed jobs yet) so you\u2019d have to realistically be able to:",
        "In my experience employers have cared very little about my past years of work experience outside tech so I really just had to go by whatever I did after.",
        "This is regardless of recruiter or no recruiter. Maybe look into networking through events and meetups where you live (I hear good things about the recurse center, which I think might still offer a remote option if you\u2019re not in NY).",
        "Still, it\u2019s very possible. You just have to stay positive, stick to it, adapt to be competitive, and potentially have to wait a good while.",
        "(obviously this is all subjective, take everything you read with a grain of salt)",
        "Well, thanks for the soberingly honest answer!",
        "Gosh, I hope this isn\u2019t universal. I\u2019m in my 50s trying to get out of teaching (secondary science) and just doing the odd bit of Codecademy when I have time in the hope of securing a tech job in 2 years or so. I hope I\u2019m not wasting my time!",
        "Depends on expectations. Look up what kind of companies and roles you\u2019re interested in and read/ask around specifically about what is needed to get in realistically. Then see if you can try to match that in terms of study, paths, etc.",
        "This has been a major difficulty for me (and one I\u2019ve posted about on here before). As someone who\u2019s brand new to learning these skills and to seeking a tech job, what I\u2019m interested in, first and foremost, is whatever will hire me. Sure, I have my interests and my preferences, but since it\u2019s all new to me, it\u2019s kind of all the same. So my question is never \u201cwhat do the roles that I\u2019m interested in require?\u201d; my question is \u201cwhat job can I most realistically get?\u201d.For instance, I\u2019m pretty good with Python and haven\u2019t learned C#, but if I found out right now that there are tons of entry-level C# jobs but not so much with Python, I\u2019d go learn C# and look for jobs that way.",

It\u2019s like if I was out in the rain and looking to get inside: I\u2019m not interested in a particular TYPE of building, I just want whatever will let me inside so I can have a roof over my head.",

        "I get your point but specificity and intent go a long way. If you\u2019re trying to go at it from what potential jobs will take you, you\u2019d have to take a sample listing of entry level positions for roles you\u2019d be willing to take (software engineer, QA tester, data analyst, cybersec, etc) and see the combo of where you are the closest to combined with which has the better ratio of supply and demand.",
        "Even within a general role, there are specific specializations that some companies favor. For example with software engineer, you can have people that have data engineering toolsets, devops, site reliability engineering, web dev, game dev, operating systems, database engineering, etc.",
        "For example cybersecurity often requires certificates, while certain sectors of software engineering are happy to take people with no college degree (while others only look at people with college degrees). Many software engineering roles heavily prefer people than can solve a good range of leetcode problems comfortably, etc. Machine learning roles usually require some form of master\u2019s degree. The list goes on and the permutations are very large.",
        "Knowing Python might be one part of the puzzle for some of these roles. My hunch is that it\u2019s never just enough alone (not necessarily that one needs to know other languages, but some other sort of skills that go along with it).",
        "For reference, on my end I am familiar with what early level software engineering roles require (only in the US). So I can give you feedback if you say, i have x, y, and z, i might be able to say if you get a, b, and c it might help your chances.",
        "But maybe you are closer to a QA testing role (pure hypothetical, I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t know that many QA testers and haven\u2019t asked them about their process). So you\u2019d go and investigate where people know what it takes and see what you would have to fill in.",

        "Based on reviewing hundreds of resumes per year and researching a book, here are the seven pieces of advice for engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "In an ideal world, you wouldn\u2019t need a resume. You\u2019d have a recruiter reach out to you along the lines of: \u201cYour ex-colleague Bob spoke extremely highly of your time working at Stack Overflow. Our company is growing, and we\u2019d love to talk with you. Do you have time to chat with a few members of the team next Wednesday?\u201d",
        "However, in reality, you will, at some point, find yourself applying at a company where Bob is not there to vouch for you, so you cannot skip through the process of being evaluated before the team will talk to you.",
        "I\u2019ve been a hiring manager for numerous companies and typically go through hundreds of resumes per year. I\u2019ve also researched the topic of writing a developer resume that represents you well while writing the book The Tech Resume Inside Out: What a Good Developer Resume Looks Like. For the book, I ended up talking with two dozen recruiters and hiring managers at the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Transferwise, and other well-known companies.",
        "Based on that experience, here are the seven pieces of advice that I give to engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "Many engineers assume their resume should just contain highlights of their employment history. They\u2019ve seen other people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles and seen a few resumes. Most of these look like this, and companies must be interested in what you did. Right?",
        "Wrong.",
        "The goal of your resume is to sell you enough to get a recruiter phone call and continue the process. This is a very different goal from telling your entire professional story. Your goal should be to showcase to the company why you\u2019re a good fit for the position they are recruiting for.",
        "This means highlighting parts of your resume that show you being a great match for a specific position. Tuning it to fit the opening might be as simple as changing the order of things or adding specific details that only this position might find interesting. When you have lots of experience, this might mean cutting less relevant parts short and leaving irrelevant things off.",
        "Here\u2019s how a typical hiring manager and recruiter will read your resume:",
        "1. Quick scan. They\u2019ll do a short scan of a few seconds, gathering all key information. Your location, years of experience, languages and technologies, position names, company names, and anything else that stands out.",
        "2. Second read. Assuming this first scan matches what they\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll re-read your resume, top to bottom, reading the content you wrote. However, if, in the quick scan, it didn\u2019t seem that you have what the position needs, there will be no second read.",
        "You should choose a resume format that helps highlight the key information the recruiter or hiring manager looks for in that first scan. A good resume template follows these principles:",
        "Why bother spending the time finding a good template? The less effort it is for a recruiter to get the key information in the quick scan, the more time they\u2019ll have to look at other parts of your resume. Here\u2019s a resume template you could use\u2014I created this template for the book, and it satisfies all the above requirements. Of course, there are many others to choose from, and you can also design your own.",
        "The recruiter or hiring manager will read your resume top to bottom. You\u2019ll want the most relevant parts to be at the top and less relevant ones towards the bottom. When you have lots of experience, it\u2019s fine to go beyond just one page: just make sure that everything relevant is still on the first page.",
        "When you\u2019re a new grad or bootcamp grad, hiring managers usually care about experience in this order:",
        "When you have work experience, the way a recruiter reads your resume changes. Here is what will be most relevant:",
        "With lots of work experience, you start to stand out from the crowd of applicants. At the same time, you\u2019ll probably have more experience than would fit on a page or two. In this case, a one-page resume is no longer a must-have, but you\u2019ll want to be more concise in your earlier experience: especially when that experience is not as relevant. Here\u2019s the order you could consider structuring your resume:",
        "It can feel painful to cut away some of your experience from your resume. But keep in mind your goal: it\u2019s to have that recruiter call. I collaborated with a systems administrator turned developer who had 20 years of experience. Ten years ago, they went back to college to get a computer science degree. Their original resume had all 20 years of experience listed: non-CS degree, ten years working as a systems admin, CS degree, ten years as a developer. The first ten years did not add much professionally to their resume: they ended up removing this, but still keeping their first, non-CS degree there. The new resume was cleaner, and they saw more callbacks with it.",
        "While you don\u2019t need to remove old positions, you should aim to reduce detail mentions significantly, except if they would add something very valuable for your current job application.",
        "Keep regional and cultural differences in mind as you craft your resume. For example, in most of the US, a one-page resume is the norm for developers with less than a few years\u2019 experience. Even more senior people aim to fit everything important on the first page. In most of Europe, resumes of two pages are common, and some hiring managers actually prefer to read longer resumes for senior people. Whatever the length, make sure you communicate the relevant parts first. Use the space wisely, elaborating more on your experiences and results that relate to the position you are applying for.",
        "Positions hiring for generalist software engineers will want to see some evidence that you have worked with a few technologies. For these places, it\u2019s a good sign if you\u2019ve mastered multiple technologies. Positions hiring for specific technologies will want to confirm that you did meaningful work with those technologies.",
        "There are a few ways you could make it clear what languages and technologies you are proficient with:",
        "1. Have a separate section for \u201clanguages and technologies\u201d on the first page of your resume.",
        "In this section, list out areas you are proficient with. Don\u2019t bother specifying your expertise level: the hiring manager will assume you know these well enough if you listed them. An example of this approach can look like this:",
        "2. Call out languages and technologies that you used as part of your work experience.",
        "An alternative to the previous approach is to mention the tools you used in each position. This gives more context on when you used these technologies or frameworks and what problems you solved using them. You could just list these out separately at the end of each position like this:",
        "However, I recommend \u201cweaving in\u201d the languages and technologies to the description itself. This both reads better, and you can give even more context:",
        "One thing I wish more resumes had is specifics. The majority of CVs I\u2019ve read tend to list responsibilities, what work was assigned, or have a hand-wavy explanation of the work. Here\u2019s an example of a resume snippet that recruiters and hiring managers see all too commonly:",
        "While the person writing these details probably felt they were showcasing the work they were doing\u2014the hiring manager gets little to no context on the specifics of the work. To stand out, be specific. To be specific, follow this approach:",
        "Having a \u201cmaster\u201d resume and tailoring it for every position you apply for is a great strategy. The tailoring doesn\u2019t have to be drastic. However, if you are applying for a company where the job listing lists the stack as React and Node\u2014and you have experience with these, among other languages\u2014moving these up front could be a small change with a big impact. Similarly, if you\u2019ve done work similar to what the position is asking for, having these bullet points listed first are all good ways to grab the attention of the person reading the resume earlier.",
        "One last thing I need to call out, as developers seeking jobs bring it up: the application tracking systems (ATS), and robots \u201crejecting\u201d your resume. This is false. Your resume will be read by a human. At tech companies, ATSes do not \u201creject\u201d resumes, and \u201crobot rejection\u201d does not exist in tech. Be wary of any resource that claims this is true: they are probably using the tactic to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt as an incentive for you to buy their service. I\u2019m saying this both as a hiring manager who has worked with ATSes and as an author who interviewed recruiters at all major tech companies. I asked them about robot rejections; they all confirmed that they have not seen or heard of such a practice.",
        "Applying for a job does not end with having a good resume. A few things can greatly help your job search: referrals, cover letters, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.",
        "Employee referrals are the best way to increase your chances of hearing back from a company. If you have a strong referral, much of the above becomes less relevant. How do you get a referral? You ask. Ask around in your network to see who is hiring. Ask on public forums where tech professionals gather like Twitter or LinkedIn\u2014potentially even Blind. You can try and reach out for a cold referral: but if you do, add context on why you think you are a great fit for a job and offer an easy way out for the person to not refer you if they do not feel comfortable doing so.",
        "Cover letters are a coin toss. For larger companies, these places usually either don\u2019t ask for one, or don\u2019t pay much attention to it. At smaller firms and startups, where hiring managers are likely to read resumes and cover letters, it\u2019s a better investment to spend time on this. Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. Don\u2019t repeat your resume: add additional details that make your case stronger as to why you are a good fit for the position you are applying to.",
        "Even if you are not looking for a job today, invest in growing your professional network. The larger your network, the easier you can get referrals from people who know the professional \u201cyou.\" To grow your network, build genuine relationships with others, help people, and make yourself visible. You don\u2019t have to do this on social media: you can start right now at your workplace, within and outside your team.",
        "LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow are all sites where having an up-to-date profile will greatly help your job search. Keep your LinkedIn up to date: it\u2019s a good idea to refresh it as you write your resume. For GitHub, consider creating a GitHub README to present yourself and your key projects more effectively. Make sure projects you mention in your resume or those that you pin to your GitHub profile also have READMEs that share what the project is about. On Stack Overflow, tailor your Developer Story to make it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to find you with relevant opportunities.",
        "For more advice, tips from recruiters in tech companies, and real-world \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d resume examples that worked, you can always grab The Tech Resume Inside Out. The book is complimentary for devs currently out of a job.",

        "Based on reviewing hundreds of resumes per year and researching a book, here are the seven pieces of advice for engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "In an ideal world, you wouldn\u2019t need a resume. You\u2019d have a recruiter reach out to you along the lines of: \u201cYour ex-colleague Bob spoke extremely highly of your time working at Stack Overflow. Our company is growing, and we\u2019d love to talk with you. Do you have time to chat with a few members of the team next Wednesday?\u201d",
        "However, in reality, you will, at some point, find yourself applying at a company where Bob is not there to vouch for you, so you cannot skip through the process of being evaluated before the team will talk to you.",
        "I\u2019ve been a hiring manager for numerous companies and typically go through hundreds of resumes per year. I\u2019ve also researched the topic of writing a developer resume that represents you well while writing the book The Tech Resume Inside Out: What a Good Developer Resume Looks Like. For the book, I ended up talking with two dozen recruiters and hiring managers at the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Transferwise, and other well-known companies.",
        "Based on that experience, here are the seven pieces of advice that I give to engineers on writing a resume that represents you as fairly as possible.",
        "Many engineers assume their resume should just contain highlights of their employment history. They\u2019ve seen other people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles and seen a few resumes. Most of these look like this, and companies must be interested in what you did. Right?",
        "Wrong.",
        "The goal of your resume is to sell you enough to get a recruiter phone call and continue the process. This is a very different goal from telling your entire professional story. Your goal should be to showcase to the company why you\u2019re a good fit for the position they are recruiting for.",
        "This means highlighting parts of your resume that show you being a great match for a specific position. Tuning it to fit the opening might be as simple as changing the order of things or adding specific details that only this position might find interesting. When you have lots of experience, this might mean cutting less relevant parts short and leaving irrelevant things off.",
        "Here\u2019s how a typical hiring manager and recruiter will read your resume:",
        "1. Quick scan. They\u2019ll do a short scan of a few seconds, gathering all key information. Your location, years of experience, languages and technologies, position names, company names, and anything else that stands out.",
        "2. Second read. Assuming this first scan matches what they\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll re-read your resume, top to bottom, reading the content you wrote. However, if, in the quick scan, it didn\u2019t seem that you have what the position needs, there will be no second read.",
        "You should choose a resume format that helps highlight the key information the recruiter or hiring manager looks for in that first scan. A good resume template follows these principles:",
        "Why bother spending the time finding a good template? The less effort it is for a recruiter to get the key information in the quick scan, the more time they\u2019ll have to look at other parts of your resume. Here\u2019s a resume template you could use\u2014I created this template for the book, and it satisfies all the above requirements. Of course, there are many others to choose from, and you can also design your own.",
        "The recruiter or hiring manager will read your resume top to bottom. You\u2019ll want the most relevant parts to be at the top and less relevant ones towards the bottom. When you have lots of experience, it\u2019s fine to go beyond just one page: just make sure that everything relevant is still on the first page.",
        "When you\u2019re a new grad or bootcamp grad, hiring managers usually care about experience in this order:",
        "When you have work experience, the way a recruiter reads your resume changes. Here is what will be most relevant:",
        "With lots of work experience, you start to stand out from the crowd of applicants. At the same time, you\u2019ll probably have more experience than would fit on a page or two. In this case, a one-page resume is no longer a must-have, but you\u2019ll want to be more concise in your earlier experience: especially when that experience is not as relevant. Here\u2019s the order you could consider structuring your resume:",
        "It can feel painful to cut away some of your experience from your resume. But keep in mind your goal: it\u2019s to have that recruiter call. I collaborated with a systems administrator turned developer who had 20 years of experience. Ten years ago, they went back to college to get a computer science degree. Their original resume had all 20 years of experience listed: non-CS degree, ten years working as a systems admin, CS degree, ten years as a developer. The first ten years did not add much professionally to their resume: they ended up removing this, but still keeping their first, non-CS degree there. The new resume was cleaner, and they saw more callbacks with it.",
        "While you don\u2019t need to remove old positions, you should aim to reduce detail mentions significantly, except if they would add something very valuable for your current job application.",
        "Keep regional and cultural differences in mind as you craft your resume. For example, in most of the US, a one-page resume is the norm for developers with less than a few years\u2019 experience. Even more senior people aim to fit everything important on the first page. In most of Europe, resumes of two pages are common, and some hiring managers actually prefer to read longer resumes for senior people. Whatever the length, make sure you communicate the relevant parts first. Use the space wisely, elaborating more on your experiences and results that relate to the position you are applying for.",
        "Positions hiring for generalist software engineers will want to see some evidence that you have worked with a few technologies. For these places, it\u2019s a good sign if you\u2019ve mastered multiple technologies. Positions hiring for specific technologies will want to confirm that you did meaningful work with those technologies.",
        "There are a few ways you could make it clear what languages and technologies you are proficient with:",
        "1. Have a separate section for \u201clanguages and technologies\u201d on the first page of your resume.",
        "In this section, list out areas you are proficient with. Don\u2019t bother specifying your expertise level: the hiring manager will assume you know these well enough if you listed them. An example of this approach can look like this:",
        "2. Call out languages and technologies that you used as part of your work experience.",
        "An alternative to the previous approach is to mention the tools you used in each position. This gives more context on when you used these technologies or frameworks and what problems you solved using them. You could just list these out separately at the end of each position like this:",
        "However, I recommend \u201cweaving in\u201d the languages and technologies to the description itself. This both reads better, and you can give even more context:",
        "One thing I wish more resumes had is specifics. The majority of CVs I\u2019ve read tend to list responsibilities, what work was assigned, or have a hand-wavy explanation of the work. Here\u2019s an example of a resume snippet that recruiters and hiring managers see all too commonly:",
        "While the person writing these details probably felt they were showcasing the work they were doing\u2014the hiring manager gets little to no context on the specifics of the work. To stand out, be specific. To be specific, follow this approach:",
        "Having a \u201cmaster\u201d resume and tailoring it for every position you apply for is a great strategy. The tailoring doesn\u2019t have to be drastic. However, if you are applying for a company where the job listing lists the stack as React and Node\u2014and you have experience with these, among other languages\u2014moving these up front could be a small change with a big impact. Similarly, if you\u2019ve done work similar to what the position is asking for, having these bullet points listed first are all good ways to grab the attention of the person reading the resume earlier.",
        "One last thing I need to call out, as developers seeking jobs bring it up: the application tracking systems (ATS), and robots \u201crejecting\u201d your resume. This is false. Your resume will be read by a human. At tech companies, ATSes do not \u201creject\u201d resumes, and \u201crobot rejection\u201d does not exist in tech. Be wary of any resource that claims this is true: they are probably using the tactic to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt as an incentive for you to buy their service. I\u2019m saying this both as a hiring manager who has worked with ATSes and as an author who interviewed recruiters at all major tech companies. I asked them about robot rejections; they all confirmed that they have not seen or heard of such a practice.",
        "Applying for a job does not end with having a good resume. A few things can greatly help your job search: referrals, cover letters, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.",
        "Employee referrals are the best way to increase your chances of hearing back from a company. If you have a strong referral, much of the above becomes less relevant. How do you get a referral? You ask. Ask around in your network to see who is hiring. Ask on public forums where tech professionals gather like Twitter or LinkedIn\u2014potentially even Blind. You can try and reach out for a cold referral: but if you do, add context on why you think you are a great fit for a job and offer an easy way out for the person to not refer you if they do not feel comfortable doing so.",
        "Cover letters are a coin toss. For larger companies, these places usually either don\u2019t ask for one, or don\u2019t pay much attention to it. At smaller firms and startups, where hiring managers are likely to read resumes and cover letters, it\u2019s a better investment to spend time on this. Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. Don\u2019t repeat your resume: add additional details that make your case stronger as to why you are a good fit for the position you are applying to.",
        "Even if you are not looking for a job today, invest in growing your professional network. The larger your network, the easier you can get referrals from people who know the professional \u201cyou.\" To grow your network, build genuine relationships with others, help people, and make yourself visible. You don\u2019t have to do this on social media: you can start right now at your workplace, within and outside your team.",
        "LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow are all sites where having an up-to-date profile will greatly help your job search. Keep your LinkedIn up to date: it\u2019s a good idea to refresh it as you write your resume. For GitHub, consider creating a GitHub README to present yourself and your key projects more effectively. Make sure projects you mention in your resume or those that you pin to your GitHub profile also have READMEs that share what the project is about. On Stack Overflow, tailor your Developer Story to make it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to find you with relevant opportunities.",

This type of event removes some of the stress and formalities that come with regular recruiting events, allowing candidates to relax and have a more personalized experience \u2014 and the casual nature of these events can apply to virtual meetups, too.",
        "You probably have a rhythm down for posting jobs on your careers page and a few popular job boards, but it\u2019s important to branch out into many different types of networks to reach diverse talent on the platforms they use. Using niche job boards not only yields a wider candidate pool, but hiring diverse talent also creates a\u00a0safer and happier work environment, making a company more attractive to prospective employees.",

        "Data driven market intelligence tracks the price of attracting talent through paid advertising.",
        "Dedicated to making hiring better for everyone.",
        "Discover how candidate assessment can help employer reduce the time-to-hire and find the right top talent.",
        "Competition for talented employees remains strong in the current hiring market. In June, the unemployment rate was just 3.6%, while employers added over 200K jobs to American payrolls. To attract the most qualified workers, companies are offering higher wages. In fact, salaries are up 4.4% from last year.",
        "While there may be a war for talent, employers must carefully assess an applicant\u2019s skills and experience to ensure they\u2019re the right person for the role. Interviews can help, but many companies also use candidate assessments to evaluate potential employees.",
        "When implemented into an employer\u2019s hiring processes, candidate assessments help streamline the experience for both applicants and companies. They provide data-driven information that hiring professionals can turn to when they\u2019re on the fence about an applicant.",
        "According to TalentLyft, assessments can decrease the time-to-hire by up to 50%. That\u2019s important because top candidates typically engage with multiple companies when looking for their newest role. If hiring professionals can get them through the pipeline faster than competitors, they are more likely to secure high-quality talent for open positions.",
        "Often, hiring professionals get bogged down in the hundreds of resumes they receive for their open roles. Spending too much time on unqualified candidates hampers the hiring process, and genuinely talented professionals may get lost in the shuffle.",
        "With a candidate assessment test, the most skilled candidates will rise to the top of the list. It takes the guesswork out of resume evaluation and helps to automate the screening process. Hiring professionals can use these results to compare candidates\u2019 skills and cultural fit and make unbiased decisions on who moves forward to the interview stage.",
        "",
        "",
        "A candidate assessment is a testing tool used to evaluate an applicant\u2019s skills, personality, or cognitive strengths. Hiring professionals can select between a broad range of examinations that fit their objectives. Sometimes, employers use a combination of tests for a holistic look at their candidates.",
        "Candidate assessments are excellent predictors of future job performance, especially when evaluating a person\u2019s skills or cultural fit. The overarching objective of the tests is to select the top applicants for a role using an informed decision-making process.",
        "Hiring professionals can administer candidate assessments at any stage of the screening process. Requiring applicants to take tests during the application stage can help recruiters sort qualified candidates from those with lesser abilities and move the top-performing ones on to an interview.",
        "Similarly, tests administered following an interview can help hiring professionals narrow down their top applicants.",
        "",
        "There are multiple advantages to using candidate assessments during the hiring process. First, they can help hiring professionals identify the top candidates in an applicant pool. These companies may overlook the most qualified people because their resumes don\u2019t reflect their skills correctly or other applicants overemphasize their abilities.",
        "By using an assessment, companies can improve the quality of their hires. They\u2019ll instantly know who their top candidates are and move away from those who aren\u2019t a suitable fit for their organization. Quality hires often improve the productivity of an organization since they have the skills and capabilities necessary to perform their roles.",
        "Similarly, a well-placed hire can decrease overall turnover rates in an organization. People who are a great fit for the role they\u2019re asked to perform are less likely to leave the company. They\u2019ll enjoy their tasks and responsibilities and fit in well with the organization\u2019s work culture.",
        "",
        "Candidate assessments can reduce the time-to-hire for an organization. Applicants who perform well on their tests will quickly attract the attention of recruiters, who can move the interview process forward with them. Rather than taking weeks or months to find the right candidate, companies can hire them within days.",
        "Once a company begins including candidate assessment tests in their hiring process, they\u2019ll see an improvement in the organization\u2019s overall talent profile. Usually, those differences become even more pronounced as the company continues to bring on people who perform well on their assessments. The result of integrating these assessments is a more cohesive workforce that shares common values \u2013 one that is better equipped for retention and high performance.",
        "Tip: It\u2019s best to integrate the tests at various points in the hiring process to see the benefits of a candidate evaluation process. Seamless testing provides a better applicant experience and helps mitigate the costs associated with one-off testing.",
        "Hiring the wrong person for an open role can be quite costly. A bad hire can adversely impact workplace productivity, employee morale, and the employer brand. It can also increase training costs and harm the company\u2019s overall profitability.",
        "",
        "Most employers use recruitment assessment tools to evaluate their candidates. These evaluations may appear as part of the initial application for the job to weed out unqualified candidates. They can also be used to better evaluate a candidate\u2019s skill level once a hiring manager determines that they meet minimum qualifications.",
        "The potential employee will receive a link to take the assessment, which they can complete on their own time. Once a candidate completes the testing process, organizations will benchmark their results against industry standards, current employee profiles, and other applicants. They can integrate results into their applicant tracking systems so all stakeholders can review them.",
        "",
        "There are several types of candidate assessments available, including all of the following:",
        "",
        "Skills tests evaluate a candidate\u2019s proficiencies in areas critical to the role. For instance, a company hiring a software engineer might use skills testing to assess their coding abilities.",
        "",
        "A work sample requires the applicant to complete a task relevant to the role and submit it for evaluation. A company looking for a talented writer might ask them to write a paper on the topic of their choice.",
        "",
        "Cognitive tests evaluate an applicant\u2019s critical thinking skills. They help recruiters understand the candidate\u2019s general aptitude and better determine how they might respond to common scenarios on the job.",
        "",
        "",
        "Motivational tests look past a candidate\u2019s abilities to determine what drives them to perform at work. They can help hiring professionals understand the type of work environment the applicant thrives in.",
        "",
        "A personality test measures a candidate\u2019s cultural fit. It can help employers understand how applicants react in different situations and how they communicate or collaborate with others.",
        "Skills-based testing is best for roles that require a high degree of technical proficiency. When filling positions that require employees to collaborate with others, hiring professionals may benefit from using personality or motivation tests.",
        "",
        "While candidate assessments can undoubtedly improve the quality of hires and reduce employee turnover, hiring managers should carefully consider a few things before implementing them.",
        "First, it helps to understand hiring objectives. An assessment isn\u2019t beneficial unless it\u2019s used to evaluate qualities that are desirable in a team. Hiring managers should search for providers that offer the tests best suited for their needs, whether they\u2019re used to assess the candidate\u2019s intelligence and personality or something more specific, like coding ability. For example, a programming evaluation tool could measure code readability and efficiency, while a typing speed test could serve as a preliminary productivity indicator.",
        "The best assessments don\u2019t take hours for an applicant to complete. Ideally, the testing will last less than twenty minutes. If it\u2019s too cumbersome, a candidate may end their application process prematurely, which means the company may miss out on a talented worker. Remember, candidate experience is important to the employer brand, and a negative experience in the hiring process can affect the employer\u2019s image.",
        "Many people submit job applications through mobile devices like smartphones or tablets. If possible, select assessments that are mobile-friendly. That way, candidates can complete them when they\u2019re on the go. They don\u2019t need to be in front of their desktop computer to take the test.",
        "",
        "Some testing providers have limitations on their integrations. Once hiring professionals find a company that provides the necessary tests, they should ensure that those tests can be easily integrated into their applicant tracking system. Proper software integrations ensure that test results appear immediately in a candidate\u2019s hiring profile so recruiters can evaluate them.",
        "Tip: While candidate assessments can tell hiring professionals a lot about their applicants, ensuring that the assessment is fair to all talent is crucial. Tests should be distributed equally among qualified workers, giving all talent the opportunity to demonstrate their unique skills and qualifications.",
        "",
        "Employers who integrate recruitment assessment tools into their application process find it much easier to evaluate applicants, especially when they receive hundreds of resumes for their open roles.",
        "Testing helps employers more effectively assess \u2013 without solely relying on interviews and resumes \u2013\u00a0 which candidates have the skills and disposition required to be successful on the job.",
        "While implementing candidate assessments into the hiring process may take a little effort, the results can pay off tremendously.",
