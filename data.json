CV vs. Job Description Matching: Allows you to input a job description and multiple CVs to find the best match. It calculates a matching score after preprocessing both the CV and job description, helping identify the best candidate.\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Key Technologies: Python, NLP, Machine Learning, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcc4 File Support: Reads text, DOCX, and PDF files\n\nThis project provides an efficient way for recruiters and job seekers to match skills with job opportunities, enhancing the recruitment process. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nYou can check out the full project on my GitHub:https://lnkd.in/eePZrrQz\nCorvit Systems Bahawalpur\nNational Vocational and Technical Training Commission NAVTTC\n#MachineLearning #NLP #DeepLearning #Python #CVMatching #JobMatching #DataScience #Flask #Recruitment #CorvitSystems",

        "ZipRecruiter, CareerBuilder, LinkedIn\u2014most of the world\u2019s biggest job search sites use AI to match people with job openings. But the algorithms don\u2019t always play fair.",
        "Years ago, LinkedIn discovered that the recommendation algorithms it uses to match job candidates with opportunities were producing biased results. The algorithms were ranking candidates partly on the basis of how likely they were to apply for a position or respond to a recruiter. The system wound up referring more men than women for open roles simply because men are often more aggressive at seeking out new opportunities.",
        "LinkedIn discovered the problem and built another AI program to counteract the bias in the results of the first. Meanwhile, some of the world\u2019s largest job search sites\u2014including CareerBuilder, ZipRecruiter, and Monster\u2014are taking very different approaches to addressing bias on their own platforms, as we report in the newest episode of MIT Technology Review\u2019s podcast \u201cIn Machines We Trust.\u201d Since these platforms don\u2019t disclose exactly how their systems work, though, it\u2019s hard for job seekers to know how effective any of these measures are at actually preventing discrimination.",
        "",
        "If you were to start looking for a new job today, artificial intelligence would very likely influence your search. AI can determine what postings you see on job search platforms and decide whether to pass your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on to a company\u2019s recruiters. Some companies may ask you to play AI-powered video games that measure your personality traits and gauge whether you\u2019d be a good fit for specific roles.",
        "AI audits may overlook certain types of bias, and they don\u2019t necessarily verify that a hiring tool picks the best candidates for a job.\u00a0",
        "More and more companies are using AI to recruit and hire new employees, and AI can factor into almost any stage in the hiring process. Covid-19 fueled new demand for these technologies. Both Curious Thing and HireVue, companies specializing in AI-powered interviews, reported a surge in business during the pandemic.",
        "Most job hunts, though, start with a simple search. Job seekers turn to platforms like LinkedIn, Monster, or ZipRecruiter, where they can upload their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, browse job postings, and apply to openings.",
        "The goal of these websites is to match qualified candidates with available positions. To organize all these openings and candidates, many platforms employ AI-powered recommendation algorithms. The algorithms, sometimes referred to as matching engines, process information from both the job seeker and the employer to curate a list of recommendations for each.",
        "\u201cYou typically hear the anecdote that a recruiter spends six seconds looking at your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, right?\u201d says Derek Kan, vice president of product management at Monster. \u201cWhen we look at the recommendation engine we\u2019ve built, you can reduce that time down to milliseconds.\u201d",
        "Most matching engines are optimized to generate applications, says John Jersin, the former vice president of product management at LinkedIn. These systems base their recommendations on three categories of data: information the user provides directly to the platform; data assigned to the user based on others with similar skill sets, experiences, and interests; and behavioral data, like how often a user responds to messages or interacts with job postings.",
        "In LinkedIn\u2019s case, these algorithms exclude a person\u2019s name, age, gender, and race, because including these characteristics can contribute to bias in automated processes. But Jersin\u2019s team found that even so, the service\u2019s algorithms could still detect behavioral patterns exhibited by groups with particular gender identities.",
        "For example, while men are more likely to apply for jobs that require work experience beyond their qualifications, women tend to only go for jobs in which their qualifications match the position\u2019s requirements. The algorithm interprets this variation in behavior and adjusts its recommendations in a way that inadvertently disadvantages women.",
        "\u201cYou might be recommending, for example, more senior jobs to one group of people than another, even if they\u2019re qualified at the same level,\u201d Jersin says. \u201cThose people might not get exposed to the same opportunities. And that\u2019s really the impact that we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d",
        "Men also include more skills on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s at a lower degree of proficiency than women, and they often engage more aggressively with recruiters on the platform.",
        "To address such issues, Jersin and his team at LinkedIn built a new AI designed to produce more representative results and deployed it in 2018. It was essentially a separate algorithm designed to counteract recommendations skewed toward a particular group. The new AI ensures that before referring the matches curated by the original engine, the recommendation system includes a representative distribution of users across gender.\u00a0",
        "Kan says Monster, which lists 5 to 6 million jobs at any given time, also incorporates behavioral data into its recommendations but doesn\u2019t correct for bias in the same way that LinkedIn does. Instead, the marketing team focuses on getting users from diverse backgrounds signed up for the service, and the company then relies on employers to report back and tell Monster whether or not it passed on a representative set of candidates.\u00a0",
        "Irina Novoselsky, CEO at CareerBuilder, says she\u2019s focused on using data the service collects to teach employers how to eliminate bias from their job postings. For example, \u201cWhen a candidate reads a job description with the word \u2018rockstar,\u2019 there is materially a lower percent of women that apply,\u201d she says.",
        "Ian Siegel, CEO and cofounder of ZipRecruiter, says the company\u2019s algorithms don\u2019t take certain identifying characteristics such as names into account when ranking candidates; instead they classify people on the basis of 64 other types of information, including geographical data. He says the company doesn\u2019t discuss the details of its algorithms, citing intellectual-property concerns, but adds: \u201cI believe we are as close to a merit-based assessment of people as can currently be done.\u201d",
        "With automation at each step of the hiring process, job seekers must now learn how to stand out to both the algorithm and the hiring managers. But without clear information on what these algorithms do, candidates face significant challenges.",
        "\u201cI think people underestimate the impact algorithms and recommendation engines have on jobs,\u201d Kan says. \u201cThe way you present yourself is most likely read by thousands of machines and servers first, before it even gets to a human eye.\u201d",
        "This article was updated on 6/25/21 to reflect that LinkedIn\u2019s new AI ensures a representative distribution of users (not an even distribution) across genders are recommended for jobs. \u00a0 ",

I interned at the Massachusetts of Institute of Technology radio news station which I loved, and embarked on a minor in psychology \u2013 understanding how people and personalities develop and grow. I studied English literature in London for a year, and I had big dreams about my career and what I\u2019d do in the world when I was older.",
        "But when I graduated, I immediately bailed on all those dreams. I worried about money and thought I had to take the first job that was offered to me. It was an entry level job as a copywriter in a scientific publishing company. I didn\u2019t like that work but was good at it, and thought it would be a stepping stone, and it was. But to what? To more work that I didn\u2019t enjoy or feel excited about.",
        "In the end, I built an 18-year corporate career that was never a good fit with who I was and what I deeply cared about, nor did it allow me to utilize my most powerful skills or ignite my passion.",
        "Why did I veer so off course?",
        "Because I didn\u2019t know how to manage my career. I never learned about career planning, and I failed to seek guidance early enough about how to create a fulfilling, long-term career. I struggled on my own, with the wrong ideas about what brings success and happiness in working life. (Turns out, happiness doesn\u2019t necessarily follow success \u2013 it\u2019s the other way around).",
        "Something happened in my life that gave me a harsh and painful wake-up call, but I didn't heed it until years after. Here's that story:",
        "",
        "If this resonates with you, I encourage you to think deeply about your own career. Are you doing work that you dreamed about when you were in high school and college? Are you making a difference in the world in the way you hoped? Are you using all those natural passions, talents and abilities that you displayed as a young adult? Are you shining?  Through my 10 years of career coaching, I\u2019ve learned that as adults, we are happiest when we are drawing on those key talents, passions and abilities that came naturally to us when we were young. We\u2019re also happiest and most fulfilled when we are using our talents in service of others. For me, as a young adult, I loved to read, write, sing and perform, teach, guide, help resolve problems, understand why people do what they do, and come up with new approaches to live more happily. Finally, in this third career, I\u2019m using every one of those skills.",
        "Drawing on your natural talents, passions and gifts makes you feel alive and of value in the world. But the vast majority of working people believe that, in order to make a sufficient living, they have to focus solely what earns money and not what they\u2019d be joyful to do. They sacrifice work fulfillment and joy for the almighty dollar, not understanding that the two are not mutually exclusive and never have been.",
        "If you feel off course and know you\u2019re in the wrong job or career, I\u2019d recommend taking these 3 steps to move away from thinking and actions that are keeping you from reaching your highest potential and being of service in the way you dream to:",
        "Move away from:",
        "1. Feeling victimized and stuck You\u2019re only stuck if you let yourself be stuck. Many of my clients and Amazing Career Project members have shared that they understand what they should do to build more satisfaction and reward in their professional life, but struggle to physically DO IT. There are both conscious and subconscious beliefs and mindsets that hold us hostage. Figure out what holds you back from taking the action you know you need to take. If you keep doing the same thing over and over, you\u2019ll never bring about any positive change.",
        "2. Thinking you don\u2019t have what it takes We often hold ourselves back from a greater life and career because we believe we\u2019re faulty, lacking, or incomplete somehow \u2013 that we don\u2019t have what others possess to be happy and successful. This type of thinking is a guarantee that you\u2019ll stop yourself from going out and getting what you want. No one \u201chas what it takes\u201d in the beginning of an important journey \u2013 we acquire what\u2019s needed by taking action throughout that journey.",
        "3. Blaming the outside world for what you aren\u2019t doing Clients come to me with all sorts of reasons why they haven\u2019t moved forward, but these reasons are simply excuses. I know because I made them all. \u201cI can\u2019t leave now because I\u2019m the primary breadwinner,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m afraid if I ask for what I want they\u2019ll fire me,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t change careers this late in the game.\u201d Yes, the economy is tough, jobs are fewer, and avenues for advancement seem less prevalent. But all of these situations can be navigated through successfully, with a concrete, well-built plan that addresses the challenges effectively.
