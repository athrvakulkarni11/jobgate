        "EDIT: A little info from Glassdoor that I learned as part of my last job in marketing:",
        "The most recent review left, regardless of its score, is weighted at 80%. This is why after a negative review is left, a company will routinely leave an onslaught of positive reviews to counterweight the negative one. Glassdoor is trash.",
        "Also, some valuable nomenclature: an Active employer is one that uses the platform to respond to reviews and maybe some other trivial touchpoint engagement. An Engaged employer may be one that pays for the service. I'm inferring from the subtle threat in Glassdoor's own content.",
        "EDIT 2: Some people are pointing out that their algorithm had detected an identical review was submitted, which was the reason for my getting banned. Problem is, I didn't leave a second review. Like I said, the original review was live for 2 months and then it was removed for the reasons cited.",
        "Original: For the past few years, I've often defended Glassdoor as a useful resource as part of any job-seeker's overall job-seeking toolkit.",
        "About a year and a half ago, I interviewed with a company that had horrendous reviews. Literally, all 15 reviews were 1-star and for the same reasons. So in the interviews, I brought up some of the themes. The hiring manager, a decent man, admitted to all of it and said he was desperately and single-handedly trying to change those issues. So in this case, the negative reviews weren't a bunch of bitter employees; they were actual experiences and issues.",
        "I elected to join the company based on this honesty and the prospect of a challenge, and of course, it was exactly like how all those reviews had said it would be. It was awful. I was thankfully laid off due to COVID.",
        "After being laid off, I left a very detailed, thorough, cutting review that within a week of being posted, had 6 'helpful' upvotes or whatever. After two months, the review was removed suddenly for violating guidelines and so was every review I had ever written. Incredulous, I reached out to Glassdoor's content management team. They would not tell me exactly what the issue was, just that I was banned from participating in their community. Finally, a service manager emailed me to say they had some proprietary algorithm that had detected language that was in violation of Glassdoor's guidelines. To be clear, I didn't use any community guideline-violating language. Apparently, they detected an identical review had been written elsewhere.",
        "I have a close family member that works for Glassdoor. I spoke to this person and found out that a very recent strategic repositioning for Glassdoor is that they are trying to become a PR company of sorts, so they are focusing on brand management for companies. As a result, they are getting very aggressive with negative review-takedowns while allowing very obviously fraudulent positive reviews to remain the same.",
        "This same company from which I was laid off, from June-August, posted 10 5-star reviews, each of which was of similar length, all with just about the same thing to say. Cliches like, \"great culture\", \"build your skills\", \"enlightened management\", \"cool tech\", \"takes care of employees\". I reached out to Glassdoor and asked them to use their \"proprietary algorithm\" to see if there was any fraud in that content, to which they said no, there was no violation.",
        "So, what I'm getting at: with Glassdoor's supposed strategic pivot to brand management, it is becoming even less reliable than it was before.",

I studied English literature in London for a year, and I had big dreams about my career and what I\u2019d do in the world when I was older.",

It was an entry level job as a copywriter in a scientific publishing company. I didn\u2019t like that work but was good at it, and thought it would be a stepping stone, and it was. But to what? To more work that I didn\u2019t enjoy or feel excited about.",

        "Because I didn\u2019t know how to manage my career. I never learned about career planning, and I failed to seek guidance early enough about how to create a fulfilling, long-term career. I struggled on my own, with the wrong ideas about what brings success and happiness in working life. (Turns out, happiness doesn\u2019t necessarily follow success \u2013 it\u2019s the other way around).",

Are you making a difference in the world in the way you hoped? Are you using all those natural passions, talents and abilities that you displayed as a young adult? Are you shining?  Through my 10 years of career coaching, I\u2019ve learned that as adults, we are happiest when we are drawing on those key talents, passions and abilities that came naturally to us when we were young. We\u2019re also happiest and most fulfilled when we are using our talents in service of others. For me, as a young adult, I loved to read, write, sing and perform, teach, guide, help resolve problems, understand why people do what they do, and come up with new approaches to live more happily. Finally, in this third career, I\u2019m using every one of those skills.",

They sacrifice work fulfillment and joy for the almighty dollar, not understanding that the two are not mutually exclusive and never have been.",

Many of my clients and Amazing Career Project members have shared that they understand what they should do to build more satisfaction and reward in their professional life, but struggle to physically DO IT. There are both conscious and subconscious beliefs and mindsets that hold us hostage. Figure out what holds you back from taking the action you know you need to take. If you keep doing the same thing over and over, you\u2019ll never bring about any positive change.",
        "2. Thinking you don\u2019t have what it takes We often hold ourselves back from a greater life and career because we believe we\u2019re faulty, lacking, or incomplete somehow \u2013 that we don\u2019t have what others possess to be happy and successful. This type of thinking is a guarantee that you\u2019ll stop yourself from going out and getting what you want. No one \u201chas what it takes\u201d in the beginning of an important journey \u2013 we acquire what\u2019s needed by taking action throughout that journey.",
        "3. Blaming the outside world for what you aren\u2019t doing Clients come to me with all sorts of reasons why they haven\u2019t moved forward, but these reasons are simply excuses. I know because I made them all. \u201cI can\u2019t leave now because I\u2019m the primary breadwinner,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m afraid if I ask for what I want they\u2019ll fire me,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t change careers this late in the game.\u201d Yes, the economy is tough, jobs are fewer, and avenues for advancement seem less prevalent.
